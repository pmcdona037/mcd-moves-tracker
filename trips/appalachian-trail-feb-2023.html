The act of following up a 180-mile section hike of the Colorado Trail in only 5 ½ days is harder than it may sound. I racked my brain all winter for the perfect trip idea ranging from early spring desert forays to longer thru hikes. After self-diagnosing myself with ‘Analysis Paralysis,’ I took on the mantra of “keep it simple, stupid.” Before I could say, “maybe the Arizona Trail is the right call for me,” I had an Amtrak ticket booked for a section hike of the Appalachian Trail. The location, the first place that inspired my adventurous spirit, Virginia. The trip that I lined up was a 160-mile section hike from the southern end of Shenandoah National Park to Harpers Ferry, West Virginia.
</p>
<p>
You may be asking yourself, “who dreams of hiking that section?” Fair question, let me introduce you to a homesick 14-year-old boy stuck in a dorm room with a view of the Shenandoah range beckoning from his window. I never dreamed about running away and living off the land like My Side of the Mountain; however, this was one of the first views that sparked my curiosity of the natural landscapes around me. Everyday, I’d watch the first light hit the distant mountains and let watch the sun duck behind the mountains framing the gorgeous sunsets that were gifted to the rolling hills of central Virginia. Over the next four years that I spent living in Virginia, I had plenty of experiences visiting Shenandoah National Park and other mountainous areas of the state, including my first backpacking trip outside of Roanoke, VA. To me, these places were where the first strikes of the flint were sparking and trying to catch fire. It took a bit of time before the flame took hold; however, I’ll always remember the first flicker of adventure that filled my spirit due to those beautiful Virginia mountains. And now, it was time to venture into the imagination of my 14-year-old self and bring those dreams into reality.
</p>
<p>
Snapping back the present moment, I had some concerns going into this trip. Despite a strong winter of training, I had fallen on my right knee and was facing lingering symptoms going into the hike. Admittedly, I was a little concerned about the knee’s ability to put up with the abuse of the Appalachian Trail for 160+ miles; however, I figured the only way to know if it could hold up was to go for it full force. Plus, I’m still in my 20s, so I’m invincible. I also had some questionable gear choices for the conditions that I was going to be facing. I knew that it was going to be cold and wet, so I packed a quilt that wasn’t warm enough, a torso length sleeping pad, a stoveless cooking setup, and no sleep clothes. To top things off, I went into the trail with a pair of shoes that were closing in on 500 miles. Stable genius over here. A bummed knee and questionable decision-making weren’t going to stop me. So, before I knew it, the journey was starting.
</p>
<p>
I went into New York City a little bit beforehand for a friend's meetup and met up with the crew that we went out to Montana with. The next morning, I had an early wake-up call for a 4:09 a.m. train to Charlottesville, Virginia. I navigated Penn Station early on a Saturday morning, got on the train, and arrived in Charlottesville around 10:45 a.m. Side note: I highly recommend taking the train to a long walk as it opens up the pathways for vulnerability at the earliest stages of the trip as you go further from your comfort zone and closer to the unknown. From there, I wanted to pick up a few things, grab something to eat, and then hit the trail. I had intended to go to Chipotle but walked the wrong way from the train station and quickly found myself on the other side of town. I stopped at McDonald's, downed a large fry, and called an Uber.
</p>
<p>
Day one started at Rockfish Gap at 11:40 a.m. The start of the trail was far less grand than the northern terminus of the Colorado Trail, even though that is also lackluster. In fact, there wasn’t even a sign signifying that I had entered Shenandoah National Park, just a QR code telling me to get a backcountry permit. The trail quickly revealed my safety net below me, Skyline Drive. The way that Shenandoah National Park is structured is that there is a single road that cuts south-to-north through the park winding through the mountains. Because the mountain range is not very wide, Skyline Drive is a common companion to the Appalachian Trail as the two weaved amongst one another throughout the duration of the National Park. I mentioned before how I can be an idiot sometimes, here is a great example. Within my first two miles, I couldn’t get over the thought that Shenandoah National Park felt like you threw North Georgia and Hudson Highlands State Park in blender in terms of the terrain and general aesthetic. Guess what falls perfectly in the middle of North Georgia and the Hudson Valley… yep.
</p>
<p>
As I was planning the hike, I wanted something that would offer a bit of distinct experience relative to the solitary physical test that I enjoyed on the Colorado Trail. The thing that I was looking for was the social component. I’ve heard the notion that “people make the trail” expounded so many times before that I wanted a bite of the proverbial apple myself. It wasn’t long before I met the first of many hikers and kicked off the experiences that made this trip so rich. Only a few miles into day one, I met a thru-hiker named Peanut. I met her before McCormick Gap, and she was a 60-plus-year-old woman. We stopped to talk, and I watched her eyes light up as she was actively reliving her experiences. One of the coolest parts of this encounter was seeing her realize that the very conversation that we were having was just another moment amidst the collection of those that had already been lived. It was a beautiful human moment, the first of many that would come about on this trip.
</p>
<p>
After my encounter with Peanut, I had my first hiccup of the trip, my water filter was nearly fully clogged. I was an idiot and forgot to check my water filter before I left. Because I forgot to check it, the universe conspired and made sure it would be clogged. It was the first time it had ever been clogged on any trip, and I could barely get any clean water out. I got enough to backflush a little bit, and it took me about 45 minutes in total to get the 0.7 liters. Despite the frustration that should have set in, I found myself pretty calm and carefree thanks to meeting some locals enjoying the beautiful day and sharing our experiences with one another. There weren't too many highlights on the day other than a little climb up Calf Mountain earlier in the day and Sawmill Run Overlook later in the afternoon. The standout highlight was the weather, 75 degrees and sunny with a few fluffy clouds giving texture to the blue skies above. The miles ticked by effortlessly and before I knew it, I was within a few miles of the shelter for the night.
</p>
<p>
In those final few miles of the day, I found myself dusting a slew of Boy Scouts and troop leaders. The little walnut that I call my brain didn’t put two and two together until my eyes painted the picture painfully clear for me. The Boy Scouts and Troup leaders that I was passing were meeting up with the much, much larger group already present at the shelter. In fact, the shelter was swimming with Boy Scouts and other hikers. I’m not talking about like 10-15 people, I’m talking a minimum of 40 all shoved into a flat-ish area. It was a ridiculous amount of Boy Scouts. Not only were the kids swarming and dashing around, but the shelter was also full of thru-hikers and section hikers. With that combination, I got a perfectly concocted version of chaos for night one of the trail. Needless to say, it was a very social first night and definitely the busiest campground I've ever stayed in. But anyways, I had a lot of good conversations and really got to lean into the social component of the hike right from the jump. The stats for the day: I did 21.7 miles with 4,839 feet of gain in six hours, 38 minutes, and 29 seconds, which came out to an average of 3.3 miles per hour. I finished out at Blackrock Hut that night and slept like shit because of two key factors, 1.) I forgot to take allergy pills, which was a big mistake on my end; and 2.) I was one of many sardines jammed into this double decker shelter and one of the other sardines was a violent sleeper with a propensity to grab whatever was in reach in the night, which included my sleeping quilt that was draped on top of me.
</p>
<p>
Spending the night as a pinata of mucus and slobber made the night drag on far longer than anyone would care for. Mercifully, day two came at last. However, day two brought the specter of a cold front promising thunderstorms and cold temperatures rolling in later that afternoon. I started at Blackrock Hut with the idea of finishing my mileage goals prior to the time it really started coming down. I was one of the first ones out of the shelter and pressed the accelerator to get the miles behind me as soon as possible. Luckily, I didn’t miss too much taking this approach as the trail was fairly ordinary without any major highlights. I hit the shelter before two o'clock and passed the time by doing a bunch of chores. This seems like an appropriate moment to mention my approach to technology on this hike as it influenced this afternoon to a high degree. I set out to use my phone only as a navigation tool, camera, voice recorder, and communication device. That meant no entertainment on demand for the duration of the trip. My day-to-day life is lived in front of screens through work, entertainment, and communication with family and friends. Out on trail, I wanted to put this dopamine factory on strike and regain my attention span and push the constant noise of the news, social media, and other distractions as far away as possible. So, there I was, on top of a mountain, with shitty weather rolling in, with only me, myself, and I. It was a lonely afternoon.
</p>
<p>
In hindsight, I feel as if I gained a lot from that quiet afternoon. I stopped reaching for a phone, computer, or screen and focused my attention on my mind’s rhythm. This is a common place where I go for profound discoveries of self and deep mindfulness where insights come to me rather than having to seek them out. As I pondered my life, identity, and whatever else came to me, I sat watching the fog roll in and the clouds just overtake everything. One minute, you could look out of the shelter and see everything in the forest, and then the next second, the white fog came rolling in at once, bringing visibility down to 50 feet. I sat in the moment suspended in time. Who knows how much time passed when I was within the fog, who knows where my mind went? Then, darkness. I was alone, except for a mouse trying to climb onto my back in the middle of the night, which was interesting. But anyway, to close the book on day two, it was 21.9 miles with 4,537 feet of elevation gain. It took six hours, 35 minutes, and 39 seconds of moving time to do that, which averages out to 3.32 miles per hour.
</p>
<p>
Now, we get to day three. I started out at Hightop Hut at 7:00 a.m., on Monday, April 7, 2025, in supremely miserable weather. Let’s set the scene. If you could time travel back to 6:30 a.m. on that Monday morning and place yourself in that shelter, you’d find a person packing up their stuff at a painfully slow rate. You might wonder what was taking so long until you looked out of the lean to and saw the sheets of water coming down in the low light of the early morning. Adding to the misery was the temperature, it was in the high 30s. To top things off, the start of the day from Hightop Hut is a short climb to the top of Hightop Mountain, about a mile or maybe a little less to get up there. But after that, a steep, long descent awaits. My brain had to go to war against the cries within to remain tucked away in the shelter, but in an almost militant fashion, I closed up the pack, donned the poncho, and took the first step.
</p>
<p>
40 degrees and rain is not a fun combination, especially when you are descending as your body heat is less abundant than on flats or climbs. The type two slog endured for a few hours, but I was able to stay warm and put some miles behind me. Before too long, I hit the checkpoint of Swift Run Gap early in the day, about four miles in. From there, I carried on, to Pocosin Cabin, about nine or ten miles into the day, where there was an awning and a picnic bench underneath. This place was an absolutely trail blessing as I was able to get some water, get some chores done, and get out of the rain. While I was under that cabin, another soaking downpour came. So, I just sat there, aired out my feet, and was able to wait out that rainstorm. I think I was there for maybe 45 delightful, dry minutes. After pouring over the maps the night before, I knew that the day held two notable two sites: Hazel Top, which was a 3,800-foot mountain, and the Big Meadows Wayside. Unfortunately, the clouds kind of hung over the landscapes for the rest of the day, even though the rain wasn't as heavy. So, I think I would have had some pretty stunning views through that section. Unfortunately, it just didn't come to fruition. I got a short, short glimpse of some sky islands where there was a cloud inversion with the peaks jutting out above them, but I just didn't get a big overlook to see how much I could see. It was a little sliver, so I have to be thankful for it, but I feel like there would have been some pretty incredible views if I had had a fully nice day, but you can't have it all.
</p>
<p>
Probably the best part of the day was the Big Meadows Wayside. I got to get out of the cold rain and fog, charged up my phone, got some desserts and snacks into my stomach, dried out some gear, went to the bathroom, and talked to some thru-hikers. Leaving the Wayside after a three-hour stay was not easy as I was happy, warm, dry, and full sitting right there, and I knew that a cold, wet four mile stretch laid before me and the end of the day. Eventually I pushed on, did the four miles and ended up at Rock Spring Hut, where I met a thru-hiker named JemandI. She is more or less a semi-homeless thru-hiker in her 60s with a really interesting story. She was kind of beat down; her husband had died, she had health issues, she doesn't have any money, and she's lost friends. All of this heavy stuff was swirling around her life, and the one thing that grounded her and kept her going was this idea to thru-hike the Appalachian Trail. It presents a key theme that I'm going to hit on later: the idea that people on the trail are in a vulnerable position, they're doing something hard, and that gives you something relatable to connect on and start the conversation. And because you're able to connect on that, you're able to get to this deeper level of conversation that you typically don't see in day-to-day life. And because of that, JemandI and I were able to talk about some real heavy stuff in both of our lives, and it was an incredible experience because this is somebody who nobody would ever talk to in a normal setting. In the capitalist materialistic world, where everyone's trying to make connections and whatever else, there's absolutely no incentive to talk to this woman or others like her. If anything, she's an undesirable that you don't want to see or hear. The fact that I got to talk to this woman and I got to hear and understand her story, is such a beautiful feeling, and it fills my heart with joy that the opportunity presented itself for me to talk to her. And this was all in the setting of it being cold as shit outside. It never got above the low 40s that day, and at night it was getting to the mid-20s. And we were also at 3,400 feet where we were camping, so it was cold, cold. We both stayed up and talked to each other despite the conditions. I did a few chores at camp and whatever, but honestly, I had an incredible experience connecting with this woman, despite the fact that I knew that I was never going to see her again. And that's part of what fills my heart with joy about the trail. Yes, the physical experience, spiritual experience, and the emotional growth that you get out there is incredible. But the one thing that I never really had on these other hikes is that social connection where you're just getting in deep with people, and you're learning more about not only them but the world and yourself when you're having these conversations. It's one of the most meaningful experiences about being on trail for me is tapping into that vulnerability, and I think seeing other people get to that place and making it feel like I'm not alone in having these vulnerable thoughts is empowering. So, that marked the end of Monday for me. The stats for the day: 25 miles on the dot, with 4,905 feet of climbing, done in seven hours, 40 minutes, and 39 seconds, which comes out to an average of 3.26 miles per hour.
</p>
<p>
Alright, so day four comes into view, and it is a cold, cold, cold, cold morning. I started out at Rock Spring Hut and it was in the low 20s. It was a funny contrast from Saturday night when I was sleeping with my sleeping quilt draped on top of me, because now, I was having to guard my water from freezing by putting it inside my shirt. Not only was the mercury lower than you’d like to see in the spring, but the wind was whipping around. That said, blue skies were above, and I was going through the highest section of the park that day. As I made my way down the trail that morning, I reached one of the few places that I’d been to in Shenandoah National Park prior to this trip. Flashing back to a few years ago, I was on a work trip when I took a rental car detour onto Skyline Drive. Looking for a quick hike to not be gone for a suspiciously long time, I went and did a short hike to the top of Stony Man Mountain, which is close to 4,000 feet. The side trail is a little off the Appalachian Trail, but you have to hike on the AT to get there. Mind you, I was in a collared shirt, khakis, and Allbirds on a 30-degree morning that day. This time around, I was about 65 miles into the trip on foot this time, rather than the leisurely drive on Skyline Drive. The feeling of traversing distance on foot is always mind-bending for me, but this time it really hit home thinking about the difference in my present situation relative to just a few short years ago. A funny part about that moment was that the water reconstituting my breakfast was freezing, so my breakfast was also freezing; I had chunks of cold-soaked chia bomb out there, which was a situation that I didn’t expect to encounter in Virginia in mid-April.
</p>
<p>
After taking down the freezing breakfast, I reached the Little Stony Man Cliffs, which was my favorite view of the entire trip. There were clouds that looked like cotton balls floating over the valleys and mountains in the distance, creating shadows that looked like giant lakes below. A rocky outcropping framed the front of your view, and from there you could see all the green in the valleys below, even though you were in this mid-winter-looking place up in Shenandoah, with blue skies dominating the sky above. It was a great moment after days of nothing but grey and fog. I would’ve liked to have spent more time there, but the 40-mph winds acted like a cruel bouncer that kicked the shit out of me, so before I knew it the view was just a memory and I had moved on. And you know, that's alright.
</p>

      </figure>
<p>
About three miles after the cliffs was the Pinnacle Picnic Grounds, and there I knew there was water and a pit toilet. So, I descended three miles to get there. I filled up my water and promptly found myself in the pit toilet to get out of the wind and do all the chores that were required. Naturally, I started recording a voice memo, filtering water, going to the bathroom, washing my hands, doing all this stuff, and the best part was I forgot to lock the door. So, when I was doing my chores, a woman opened the door and screamed her head off. She acted like it was the craziest thing she'd ever seen, a hiker doing chores in a pit toilet, but the best part about it was that it was captured on voice memo. So, this lady screaming at me being in the pit toilet while I was in there is forever memorialized in the audio journals I kept on the trail. The weather stayed beautiful all throughout the day. I got up to the Pinnacle and had this beautiful ridgeline walk. I stayed up pretty high all day and had an awesome day. It was about three or four miles after the pit toilet that I reached something called Mary's Rock, which was another gorgeous view. It was a little off-trail, but I made a quick detour to see a highlight of the park. It was a beautiful view, but again, it was that same side of the mountain that was just getting pounded with wind that day, the west-facing slope. So, I got tossed around by the wind but left with a fresh memory to draw on for the remainder of my days.
</p>
<p>
From there, it was more or less pretty average in terms of beauty. The shining sun above melted away any potential monotony and time slipped below the soles of my feet. I found myself at Little Hogback Mountain at the end of the day and plopped down for dinner. A cold-soaked rice and bean delight. After dinner, I made my way to a shelter that was at the lowest elevation I could camp at without blowing myself out for the day. The impetus for doing so was that the overnight temperatures were supposed to be in the high teens or low 20s.
</p>
<p>
Anyways, I got to the hut an hour or two prior to sunset, and I'd been reading comments in FarOut all day about a skunk taking up residence in the shelter, and I had run into someone saying, "Oh, watch out, there's a skunk there." I brushed that off as a one-off event and went to bed tucked away in the bivy and in my puffy to stay warm, and I was perfectly fine. If anything, I was a little too hot. I think it got down to like 18 or 19 degrees at night, but I was woken up at about -- yeah, well, I'll get into it on the next one. I'll just wrap up day four, which was Tuesday. I had done 29 miles with 5,502 feet of elevation gain in nine hours, four minutes, and 39 seconds, which comes out to an average of 3.19 miles per hour.
</p>
<p>
So, day five was Wednesday, and I started at Gravel Springs Hut. As I was previously alluding to and stopped earlier, I woke up at 4:30 a.m. to a scratching noise. It was just right by my head, and I knew that it was the skunk. Now, being in that situation is a bit of a weird one because if I moved too fast or spooked the critter, it's going to spray me, spray all my gear, and it's just going to be a horrible situation. So, I had to delicately get out of the bivy, get out of the sleeping bag, and try to be pretty light on my feet and quiet so as not to scare this skunk. As a reminder, 4:30 a.m., pitch black out, and 18 to 20 degrees. I gathered my things, and while I was doing some early morning chores, I set up my phone on astrophotography mode getting a great shot of the night sky. With the shot of the night sky captured and chores done; I started out the day by hiking in the dark. At this point in my outdoors career, I was pretty comfortable with hiking in the dark and this night hiking session had a great reward. It's called Mount Marshall, and it's 3,300 or 3,400 feet, and I started out hiking pretty early because I knew that I wanted to see the sunrise at the top of the mountain that marked the spiritual northern end of the National Park and the last 3,000 foot peak on the Appalachian Trail until Massachusetts. At the top, I was treated with this dome effect where it's just a pink sky that circles the entire world around you. There weren't clouds lining up above me, so it wasn't one of those dramatic sunrises, but just a beautiful, leaky sunrise that reinvigorated my heart and soul. As you may have guessed, I am freezing at this stage in the day. Not only is it the coldest part of the day and trip overall, but I’m also gaining over a thousand feet of elevation, meaning that it is 3-5 degrees colder from where I slept. I'm hiking in a puffy at this point, which is something that I had never really done before this morning. At the top of Mount Marshall, the vision of the day became much clearer as I only had 13 or 14 miles to the Front Royal road crossing. So, I started descending, and I knew that coming out of the park, Shenandoah National Park is at a much higher elevation than the surrounding areas in Northern Virginia, so there's a big descent down from the park to get to the road crossing by Front Royal. So, I kept the puffy on all morning because it was cold, and because of the cold, it just took longer doing chores: filtering water, breakfast, going to the bathroom, all that. I hit the end of the park at 10:00 a.m., snapped a picture of the sign signifying the end, and carried on. It was pretty cool; that was a big milestone that I was looking forward to on the trip, and this is kind of a bucket list experience: finishing the Appalachian Trail through Shenandoah National Park. Anyways, within an hour, I reached the road crossing that would take me to Front Royal at about 11:00 a.m. There was a shuttle from town that was supposed to come at 11:45, but naturally, I stuck out a thumb, someone picked me up before, so I hitched into town, went to the post office, grabbed my resupply box, made some calls, charged my phone, and repacked my bag. That didn't take too long; I didn't go into town and grab food or anything. I finished my chores at the Front Royal Post Office and took an $7 Uber back to the trail. At that point in the day, I was feeling great.

<p>
Immediately coming out of Front Royal, there is a pretty long climb, and my thought was, "All right, I’m going to rip this climb, I’m going to see what I can do." Overconfidence took over and I took that climb way too fast, and what happened was that I got some pretty serious lower calf and Achilles pain. From there, I was in pretty considerable pain on every step. I made my way to Manassas Gap Shelter. Manassas Gap Shelter was about 24 miles into the day, and I was sitting there, telling myself, "Dude, don't go any further, like your calves are messed, your Achilles is a ticking time bomb, you know? That's not something to play games with." And then, I looked the weather up above me. I'm like, "Dude, perfectly sunny, it's in the 50s. This is such a unique weather situation. You need to go hike. You need to go hike." I kept telling myself that.
</p>
<p>
I had actually eaten dinner at Manassas Gap Shelter, sent a message on my Garmin dropping a pin for my camping location, and started nightly chores. In a flash, I left that all behind, I got up and left. I had five miles to the next shelter, which was Whiskey Hollow Shelter. And I just told myself, "Take it slow. It doesn't matter how fast you take this, just get to the shelter and call it good." There wasn't much climbing, and climbing was causing the pain in my lower leg. The part about the Whiskey Hollow Shelter that I wasn’t aware of is that it was 0.3 miles off-trail. So, when I arrived, I was a little pissed because of the extra steps and the nagging pain. That sour mood slipped away quickly when I saw how nice the shelter was, a picture-perfect AT shelter. After marveling in the beauty of the shelter from afar, hiking poles out front came into view signifying the presence of a fellow hiker. That fellow hiker, Chris "Hawkeye," became a fast-friend. A perfect situation. But seriously, this was a two-story shelter with a full-on upper deck and a window looking out. You could hear the bubbling stream sounds down below, and there was a picnic bench under an awning.
</p>
<p>
Even though the last ten miles of the day were pretty painful, I was happy that I soaked up the beautiful weather and continued on. I took the end of the day a little bit slower: I was stretching, I was taking off my shoes and putting my feet in streams, and all that fun stuff. That day turned out to be a substantial mental battle that I had to work through, and it weighed heavily on my mind throughout that back half of the day, but I got through it. Honestly, I had a fantastic day looking back at it and that type-two fun of suffering a little bit because my body didn’t feel right added to the mystique in a way. I was out in these pristine conditions, I had finished the Shenandoah National Park section, descended out of the park, gone to town, and arrived at a gorgeous shelter with fantastic company. So, to close out day five, Wednesday, it was a 29.2-mile day with 5,230 feet of climbing. I did it in nine hours, eight minutes, and nine seconds, which comes out to a 3.19-mile-per-hour day.
</p>
<p>
I went from one of the best days on the trip to one of the worst. Thursday, I woke up at Whiskey Hollow Shelter. After cosplaying weatherman at the shelter, myself, along with a new friend, Chris, determined that getting to the finishing point of the day by two o'clock was going to keep us dry. So, in my head, it was like, "All right, 19 miles before 2 p.m., that's got to get done." There were some issues that were impeding that, though. First of which was the cold. It was again in the 20s when I woke up, so my water was freezing, the conditions were damp and grey, and my right lower leg was not feeling good. I had initially thought that it was a calf thing, ultimately what it was; it was the insertional portion of the Achilles tendon on the heel. I just told myself, "Dude, you're going go finish this trail, you have time to recover after this. Go finish this section and then assess the damage after." As the day started, my leg was not doing great, but it was loosening up a little bit. Sky Meadows State Park, a place with early memories in my relationship with my partner, was about two or three miles into the day. My new friend, Chris, had left about 10 or 15 minutes earlier than me from the shelter, and I passed him when we went through Sky Meadows State Park. I wish it would have been prettier; it was gray and misty and cold, but I made it to Ashby Gap, had a sketchy highway crossing, and then had a climb that took me through some beautiful patches of Virginia bluebells. Maybe like an hour later, I arrived at the south-end of the Virginia roller coaster. The roller coaster is notorious for just being a series of rocky, pointless ups and downs with no views. To a lot of people, this is like an actual physical struggle. To me, it was a total mental struggle. My lower leg was not doing good; it was painful on every step. The roller coaster is notorious for being up and down and those up and down sections hurt my leg the most. Flat was the only time when I got a little bit of reprieve, and there was nothing flat this entire day, and I knew going into it, and I knew that I was going to have to go quick. I had to go quick because rain was coming, I didn't want to get wet, and I wanted to keep my gear as dry as possible.
</p>
<p>
I hit the roller coaster in wet, windy conditions that made for a very annoying experience, and to add insult to injury, it was a painful day of hiking. It was exactly how people describe it: just up and down, no views, and you don't want to be on it when it's wet. I got the unlucky combination of having kind of a mix of all of that. I wanted to keep things light to keep the load off my legs, so I didn't have much water at all. In fact, I only drank like a liter while I was moving the entire day. The north star that day was a hostel called the Bear's Den. Bear's Den is right at the northern end of Virginia, right near the border with West Virginia, on the Appalachian Trail. I made it there right before it started raining, at 1:45 p.m., minutes before the rain started coming down.
</p>
<p>
When I got there, I was the only hiker there and I was able to talk to the volunteer and get a view into her interesting life. My friend from the previous night, Chris, made it about an hour and a half later and he was soaked; he got dumped on when he was out there. So, it was a very good decision for me to rush and get there when I did. The nice part about my early arrival was that I was able to let my Achilles heal up a little bit because I was done at 2:00 p.m., so I had that time to recover at night. I paid for the “Hiker Special,” which included a bunk, shower, laundry, a full pizza, and a full pint of ice cream for $40. Naturally, I ate that in the blink of an eye. I hung out with two other hikers, Sly Rule and Hawkeye, upstairs in front of a roaring fire for most of the night before retreating down to the bunkroom. The most interesting part about this day was the fact that when I went back downstairs, there was a backpack with this huge Notre Dame logo on it. I could recognize it from anywhere; it was a bookstore backpack. I asked the guy about it in the bunk above me, "Yo, did you go to Notre Dame?" And he's said, "Yeah." I'm like, "Oh, sweet, I did too. What year did you graduate?" “2020.” This random hostel on the AT in Virginia, in the middle of nowhere, had two graduates from the same class at the University of Notre Dame sharing a bunk with one another without even knowing it. The coincidence was just too wild to make sense. I didn't end up talking to that guy too much; he was out with his friends, and I caught up with him the next morning, but yeah, it was a crazy situation, pretty unbelievable that the stars aligned in the way they did.
</p>
<p>
So, to close out day six, Thursday, it was the hardest day out on trail. I tackled the majority of the roller coaster, had shitty weather, lower leg pain, all that fun stuff, but I got in 18.8 miles. It had 4,409 feet of gain. I did it in six hours, 48 minutes, and 28 seconds, and I did it at an average of 2.76 miles per hour.
</p>
<p>
I wasn’t sure if Friday was going to bring a rest day or my final day on trail when I woke up. The pain in my lower leg was going to dictate the plan of the day and I’d decided that I’d go from there. My first step out of bed was the key indicator as to what the day would hold, and luckily, the pain had subsided a bit. I had a slow start to the day, but I eventually exited the hostel and made my way out into the foggy mist. The morning started by me reaching the end of Virginia and entering West Virginia. The trail through West Virginia was easy and the rain held off despite threatening throughout the duration of the day. The trail was on a ridgeline the whole day, and I hiked all 22 or 23 miles on just one 700-milliliter bottle of water. There wasn’t anything too notable about this section until I reached the greater Harpers Ferry area. The trail around Harpers Ferry and the town itself was absolutely gorgeous. I didn't know that it was where the Potomac and the Shenandoah met and was treated by a show-stopping intersection of two major east coast rivers. To close out the trip, I made my way through the historic portion of Harpers Ferry, crossed the bridge into Maryland, completing the West Virginia portion of the Appalachian Trail, and formally finished my section hike.
</p>
<p>
From there, I visited the Appalachian Trail Conservancy headquarters and made my way to the Halfway Hideaway hostel, where I stayed for the night. I got some ice cream from a local place and licked my wounds from the lower leg pain, and I was able to talk to the hikers staying there. One of which tried to give me the trail name "Fleet Feet," which I have shut down and will not be taking. The hostel was great. It's run by a Triple Crowner who's hiked the PCT, CDT, and AT four times. The few people that were staying there were a little weird, but I had a good social experience again, and I had finished my goal. I finished the trip by getting to Harpers Ferry, I did 160 trail miles, 170 miles overall including off-trail mileage. Getting to Harpers Ferry was a really cool moment because, I had done the Colorado Trail section hike before, and that was this big trip that I really built up in my head; however, I didn't think of this trip was as big of an undertaking. Even though it was 10 miles less than the Colorado Trail section hike, this hike traversed the entirety of a National Park, had more up and down, had harsher weather, had more wildlife problems, etc. The conditions were a lot more difficult. So, it's all a matter of perspective, but I finished the goal, I set out to do it and knocked it down.

<p>
Day eight, I was technically done. I did like two and a half miles walking around town and seeing the National Park area of Harpers Ferry. But it was a travel day, so I woke up at the hostel, had a slow morning talking with a few of the accomplished hikers and picked their brains on what works for them. The owner of the hostel’s trail name is Hippie. He was a cool dude, good to hang out with, and I left the hostel before 10 a.m., went to this place called Boulevard Bread Company and got some stuff for the road. I went around Harpers Ferry, like I mentioned, explored the area, and then got to the train station. When I was there, I made a friend. Her name was Waverly, and we talked the whole train ride and parted ways. From there, we actually bumped into each other in the Metro and helped her find her way through it, and the trip ended with my partner picking me up at Dulles, and it was over. I was back in the soft embrace of civilization.
</p>
<p>
I think the most profound part about these trips is that it allows me to get vulnerable and get meaningful takeaways that I can move into the rest of my life. It exposes fears and lies that I might tell myself. It presents this very powerful way to discover who I am, what I’m about, what I want, what I don't want, all that. It puts me in a position where you get to evaluate my life without any noise around it. I just get to see the facts, and it's a really interesting way to view the world and to have an experience that kind of gets me out of the normal rhythms of day-to-day life.
</p>
<p>
These thoughts are going to be a little scattered; it's just what I wrote down when it was popping into my mind and stuff immediately after the trip, so bear with me here. The first big takeaway that I had was that ultralight backpacking and backpacking are going to be a core part of my life for as long as it's possible. It's something that gives me so much, brings me so much joy. I'm absolutely passionate about it, and it's one of those things where it feels like I got the bug, and it's impossible to get rid of it now. I don't think that's a bad thing. I absolutely adore it, I'm good at it, and it just feels right. It feels harmonious with my life and how I want to live. I think with the Colorado Trail trip, I was trying to figure out, like, "All right, do I want this to be a lifestyle?" as opposed to just enjoying the fact that it's in my life presently. I think that the acknowledgment of and being in the present moment in my life and the fact that it should hopefully be in the present for a long time is a powerful insight.
</p>
<p>
A second insight, and I feel like I have this takeaway all the time, is that phone and computer use is really bad for me. I think one of the reasons why I gravitate towards having more of a blue-collar, community-based job is because I don't want to sit in front of a computer all day. I feel like I have pretty decent self-control, but when it comes to phone and computer usage, I feel like I struggle. I need to be conscious of the fact that whenever I pull up my phone or computer and I go to Reddit and I think that it's this harmless thing, it's changing my brain chemistry in a way that I'm not fully aware of, and even though I might think that it's perfectly fine to just scroll for a little bit because I'm bored, I have to think of the broader implications of what that's causing me to do. It's just something that I need to be much more mindful of, and I think that the perfect replacement for that is having the Kindle and just having books to read. Because if I'm sitting here just pulling up Reddit and wasting my life by looking at it, that does nothing good for me. If I read books and I'm doing all this stuff, at least I'm getting some sort of valuable insight as opposed to this short-form news, reading other people's comments, all that nonsense. One of the cool parts about this trip was that I intentionally tried to not going on my phone, not checking the news, all that. What's funny is that nothing really changed. I had this assumption that, "All right, I’m not going to check the news and I’m going to miss out on important stuff in life." That wasn't my experience at all. It's just kind of a kick in the teeth to say, "What are I doing then? Why am I using it so much? It's doing no good for me. If anything, it's harming me, stop." And that's something that, two months removed from the trip, I'm struggling with again, so I need to get some sort of thing in my life that I can lean on and say, "All right, be good. This isn't what I need to be doing," and I just need to be more intentional about it.
</p>
<p>
Another thing, I need to find a job that connects me with the community, and I'd like to put down roots somewhere. I have this pull to become a teacher, and I really feel strongly about that being a good idea for me. While a lot of other people might not understand why I would give up an investment banking, a finance career and money and prestige, whatever, why I would want to do that, but teaching to me feels like the best thing that you could possibly do as a job, teaching the next generation and being there to mold the minds of our future. I think a lot of that is just the fact that I would love to have a community that I can rely on, and I think that being a teacher and integrating myself in the community like that would be really good for me.
</p>
<p>
I know I'm jumping around all over, it's going from technology to career to health here, but this one is: drink more water and eat healthy. I think that I get into this competitive mindset of, "Oh, my body's more efficient than other people. I don't need as much water." But it's not doing anybody any good by me drinking less water on trail. Water is the lifeblood of your body, and you just need it. So, at the end of the day, there's no reason not to drink water. I think I was a little dumb on this trip of not doing great with that, and I just need to be better about eating healthy, working out my upper body, working on my core, and all that stuff. Another part about the whole healthy stuff is stretching is important to me, and I know that if I don't stretch, injuries pop up, so I need to make stretching a core part of my life. Inflammation is one thing that I've noticed that keeps popping up. So, when I eat inflammatory foods, my heart rate spikes, you know, my joints hurt a little bit more, all that fun stuff, so I need to focus on having an anti-inflammatory diet and lifestyle.
</p>
<p>
These are a little bit of the more profound takeaways that are a little bit more psychological, emotional, spiritual, whatever you want to call it, but the first one is that the mind controls the body. The whole time that I was out there, I learned that the mind just goes, and it flows from one thing to another. It can be logistics one moment; this deeply philosophical thought in the next; only to arrive at a craving for a pint of ice cream or pizza. Not only can the mind wander to unknown places, but it can also make your body do things that you don't want it to do. Like if the mind gets a little idea, like signaling that bailing out on the hike is the right call, whether it be to the rain, hunger, injury, etc., the body is going to reinforce what the mind is telling it. But if the mind is properly controlled, and you can say the rain's good, the rain is great, the rain gives the world life, every other animal loves the rain. Sure, it's cold, it's wet, but the rain's a good thing, putting out fires, it's giving life to the ponds and the lakes and the creeks that need it. Just because it might be a little uncomfortable in the present moment doesn't mean that you have to hate it. You don't, you can just go hike, and you're going to be fine. That's where the mind controls the body. Once you get over that, the body starts moving, the mind shuts off and you don't think about it. It works in other ways, too, like with pain. Another tagline that I was thinking about while I was on the trail was “pain fluctuates and migrates throughout the body.” When you're out on trail, there might be a twinge here and there, but there are no guarantees that that's going to hurt in the next five minutes. There's no guarantee that it's going to hurt the next day. There's no guarantee that it's going to get better either, pain changes when you're out on trail, especially when you're doing big miles. I haven't gotten to the opportunity to get trail legs and understand what that feels like, but I do have a better understanding of how pain works and how your mind is the quarterback of that pain. If you stress yourself out, if you're worrying about it, it's not going to do anything any good. You just have to have a very rational, logical mind when it comes to pain. Outside of that, I think emotionally the mind controlling the body is a huge thing. Because if you tell yourself that you're just having this shit time and you're hiking through gray clouds, cold weather, and nothing's really exciting, you can pretty easily convince yourself that, "Oh man, I don't like hiking or backpacking like this, this kind of sucks." But I'm able to keep my mind in a place that resembles the following state: "This is such a beautiful experience. You're living this experience truly and wholesomely," despite fluctuating conditions and injury status. The mind controlling the body is the biggest thing x-factor one can have. I could have easily stopped at the Manassas Gap Shelter. I could have easily spent a zero day at Bear's Den. I could have easily just stopped before Harpers Ferry and gotten picked up. I could have easily just not crossed over into Maryland. There are these active decisions that I'm making in my mind, and my body's following. So, being the master of your mind is very important, and being able to dictate your thoughts is a big part of backpacking and life as a whole.
</p>
<p>
Another big difference in this section hike relative to the Colorado Trail was that I didn’t feel the need for external validation. I feel like before, during, and after the Colorado Trail section hike, I was looking for that, even if I don't want to admit it. I wanted people to see, "You're doing this cool thing by yourself. Like, you're pretty badass." But this hike, I didn't care. I didn't really tell anyone besides the people who needed to know, and I just went out and did it and didn't feel the need to send any pictures to anybody or really tell anyone. If they figure it out, sure, I'll talk their ear off about it because I loved it, but I didn’t have that need for external validation, and I hope that I'm over that need for it. I think that deep down I'm a social creature, and I have insecurities, and part of that is I want people to think that I'm fun, cool, all that. I think that's where the need for external validation comes from, but I also have this understanding of just needing to do things to feed my own soul and curiosity. Ultimately, I really love doing this stuff, and external validation doesn't need to be a factor.
</p>
<p>
One of the last things that I came away with on this trip is the idea that I need to live my life and roll with the punches. There's no need to force anything. That idea of forcing stuff for a timeline or somebody/something else doesn’t really make sense to me. This is actually a very good day to talk about it because I just had this restorative yoga session, and for background, I am one of the last people to want to go to yoga classes and do all that type of stuff on my own. But this class in particular brought about a powerful idea, the concept was having a mindfulness bowl where thoughts and emotions fall into rather than forcing any state to be. You can try to force these thoughts, you can try to force these actions, you can try to force these emotions, and you can strain yourself doing that. The reason why this came up in the restorative yoga session was the instructor was asking us, "Hey, what are your core values as a person?" I remembered sitting there for like 10 or 15 seconds, stuck in this strange place of thinking, "What are my core values? What are they?" It's an unsettling feeling of hunting for answers to these questions, trying to force it in, grab it, and pull it down and dissect it. But the second that I stopped trying to force stuff, and I just thought about this bowl of mindfulness and letting things fall into it, and from there, developing the thoughts became simple, it was amazing. The transformation that came within, in not that long of time, a few breaths, I was able to come up with a fully formed thought for the first core value, for the second core value, and then came up with the third core value shortly thereafter. It was beautiful. Then, after that core value thing, they talked about your passions, and this imagery came so crisp to me about being near Searle's Pass and the little seeds floating in the late afternoon sunlight through the section above tree line. I really thought deeply about my life, and all this came because I wasn't trying to force anything. I wasn't trying to convince myself that I was anybody that I wasn't. This one exercise got me more in touch with my spiritual side. It was gorgeous, truly, I loved what came out of it. By having this mindfulness bowl that things can seem, sink into, and you can tap into, it's this really beautiful way of conducting yourself through life.
</p>
<p>
I'm very grateful for this hike. You know, frankly, I was going out there with a lot on my mind and my brain going in a million different directions. I think that I have been forcing some thoughts and it’s time to let life come to me a little bit. I have a great job, a great partner, a great family, and a slew of other amazing things going the right way for me. It's tough to give up all these great things in my life for the greener pastures of an adventurous life, and I don’t want to. At some point, I will have to carve out the time to do the things that light up my imagination, but it might not be this year or this decade, and that's okay. I think that there's been this huge transition within myself being a little bit more loosey-goosey when it comes to life. There have been tremendous growing pains on a personal level that have strained various components of my life; however, this refreshed mindset has allowed me to arrive at a place of peace internally. I think that there are certain things that I need to be more pointed on and make decisions and carry on, but at the same time, I don't think that it's the worst thing in the world to take in different information, letting my emotions and feelings and actions change based on how I decide to live my life.
</p>
<p>
Anyways, I don't really have anything else from the AT section hike. I really loved doing the trip in somewhat of a social way. I really do like putting down bigger miles. There's stuff that I want to try out for future backpacking trips, like chemical water filtering, single-walled tents, etc., but I don't think that's necessarily relevant to talk about in a recap. I wish my body had felt better at the end. I wish the weather would've been better. There were a few things gear that I might have tweaked on the margins. But overall, what an experience to be able to tackle something like Shenandoah National Park. That place just holds a substantial part of my heart, and it was such a blessing to enjoy the land in a deep, interconnected way on the Appalachian Trail.
