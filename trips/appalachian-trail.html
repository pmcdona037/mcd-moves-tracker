Ready for a formal greeting to a trip report? No? Whatever, this is my creative outlet and you’re going to get everything that comes with that process, the good and the bad. This is likely the bad variety.
</p>
<p>
Hello and welcome to the trip recap and report for my Appalachian Trail section hike through Vermont and Massachusetts. I started in Hanover, New Hampshire on September 5, 2025, and finished in Great Barrington, Massachusetts, on September 14, 2025. The official start time was 10:15pm in Hanover, and I wrapped up at 9:58am in Great Barrington, finishing in just under eight days and twelve hours, despite spending nine nights on the trail. Through this recap, I’ll walk through the logistics, mileage, stats, and other details from the hike.
</p>
<p>
Was that good enough? Probably not. I could’ve waxed poet about my love for Vermont and how I’d been dreaming of doing something like this for years. Or how this trip was originally intended to be a trip on the PCT and JMT in California. But who cares? I like long-distance backpacking, Vermont rules, and California would’ve been a smoke-filled web of logistical nightmares. So, Vermont it was and the all-too-familiar white blazes charted my course through the woods. Let’s dive in.
</p>
<p>
The trip began in New York City. I worked a normal day for my normal job in my normal apartment, passed a bunch of normal people to walk to a normal block in Midtown, and left the normalcy behind as I boarded the Dartmouth Coach bus up to Hanover, New Hampshire. It left at perfect time to hit the worst of Friday New York City traffic, 4:30pm, and pulled into Hanover around 10:10pm that evening. I watched Moneyball on the ride, which was a lot better than I remembered, chatted with the bus driver, and sat with my thoughts on the trip to come. I mentioned this in my previous trip report, but I’m a big believer in using public transit to start the trip. It zaps you into this place of shocking vulnerability. You know you’re getting further and further away from your comfort zones, the people you love, and the familiar, and that intensifies the entire experience. Anyways, as far as long bus rides go, this one was pretty good.
</p>
<p>
By the time I got to Hanover on Friday night, I felt ready to go. The bus dropped me at the Dartmouth Green, and from there I had to make my way to proper streets adorned with the white blazes to begin a road walk. Within fifteen minutes, I crossed a bridge over the Connecticut River, which marks the Vermont–New Hampshire border, and soon after kept on the road into Norwich, Vermont. From there, I turned onto Elm Street and immediately started climbing a very steep road in the dark underneath a full moon, which ratcheted up the intensity right away. At the top where the asphalt came to an end, I took a left onto the Appalachian Trail, and suddenly I was on smooth, singletrack terrain. Hiking through the night wasn’t too difficult aside from the fact that it was dark (duh). I covered 5.7 miles with 1,391 feet of elevation gain before stopping at Happy Hill Shelter, where I slept in the shelter itself. I got in around 12:30am. There were no spooky encounters, no bears or Sasquatches lurking in the woods, just me walking quietly through the night and settling into the rhythm of being out there.
</p>
<p>
The next morning brought a little rain in the forecast, and I reminded myself not to blow up my body too early in the trip, as one of my goals for the trip was to build into it gradually. I left Happy Hill Shelter and made my way toward West Hartford, about four miles in. The trail dropped steadily at first before turning into a road walk that carried me across the White River. At just 370 feet of elevation, it was one of the lower points of the hike, but from there the day grew much harder, climbing back up to nearly 2,000 feet. I hadn’t expected to drop that low or have to climb so much so early, and it caught me off guard. Along the way, I saw some of the last northbound thru-hikers of the season and passed a couple of shelters, including Thistle Hill and Cloudland, but most of the day was about adjusting. My body needed time to adapt to the heavy pack, the up-and-down terrain, and the elements. I kept checking in on myself, my Achilles, my knee, and how my energy was holding up. Everything passed the sniff-check so the plodding proceeded as previously scheduled. The farmland vistas were beautiful in places, with some open pasture stretches, but the elevation changes were more demanding than I had pictured. I had thought this stretch before the Long Trail would be gentler, but it turned out to be more steep, just at a lower elevation.
</p>
<p>
By midday, some rain had begun falling, and those picturesque pastures that I had previously mentioned turned into makeshift carwash cleaners for my legs and shoes. There was no running from wet shoes and legs. So, what can you do other than embrace it? And, I remembered a conversation that I had with Hippy from my VA/WV section hike, where he talked to me about his perspective on rain and water while out on trail. Hippy welcomed the wetness, mentioning how rain is a life-giving miracle to all the creatures that live out in the wilderness, including those humans that decide to be there voluntarily. Leaning into that thought, I didn’t really care that I was wet, rather I was happy that this drought-riddled landscape was finally getting some much needed water.
</p>
<p>
I had set the Wintturi Shelter as my goal for the day, about 21 miles in, telling myself I could stop there if I needed to. By the time I arrived, I’d met another hiker from Seattle around my age, filled up on water, and thought about whether I had enough left in me to push a little farther. In the end, I decided to go on to The Lookout, a private cabin on top of a mountain that’s open to hikers. It was only a short but steep detour from the trail, and when I arrived the timing was perfect. At just over 2,400 feet, the forest had shifted to birch, spruce, and fir, making it feel higher and more alpine even though I wasn’t yet in the main spine of the Green Mountain range. Storm clouds rolled by in the distance as the sun broke out upon my arrival. I climbed onto the roof of the cabin and was fortunate enough to take in the view, an incredible, fleeting moment suspended in time.
</p>
<p>
That night I cooked dinner, stretched, and settled in, only to notice a mouse running across the ceiling when I tried to fall asleep. It was just part of the experience, though, and I managed to rest well enough. My total for the day came to 23.5 trail miles with 6,854 feet of elevation gain. It had been a demanding day of settling in, working through the shock to my system, and beginning to find the rhythm of the trip. The Lookout turned out to be a special place to end the day, and I was glad I made it there.
</p>
<p>
The next morning, I had my sights set on Killington Peak at 23.8 miles as the next big target, with plenty of options for where to stop along the way, depending on how my body and the weather held up. This day marked the end of the “connector” section, bringing me closer to the core of the range, and Killington Peak stood as a kind of spiritual gateway into the spine of the Green Mountains. Doesn’t Killington Peak just sounds really cool too? I don’t know, to me, it has a pretty cool ring to it.
</p>
<p>
Anyways, the first stretch of the day was relatively uneventful. The climbs were manageable and nothing severe, and it wasn’t until about twelve miles in that the day started to feel more noteworthy. I passed Thundering Brook Falls, though, in truth, it wasn’t very thundering. The flow was light, another reminder of the drought affecting Vermont and Massachusetts at the time, which made water sources a little trickier than expected. That area also included a nice boardwalk section where I encountered some day hikers, before moving past Kent Pond and Gifford Woods State Park. Soon after, I reached the main junction where the Appalachian Trail connects with the Long Trail. For northbound hikers, this is where the AT splits away toward Maine, but for me, it meant I had officially entered the section I was most excited about.
</p>
<p>
From there, the intensity picked up for the day. I dropped down to a road crossing that could have taken me into Rutland, then immediately began the long climb up Pico Mountain and eventually toward Killington Peak. It was a steep, demanding ascent that seemed to drag on endlessly, especially with the soreness from the previous miles still lingering. About a third of the way up, I ran into a woman who startled me by stepping out of the brush, she had either been looking at plants or using the bathroom. Her name was Anaya, and as we talked, it became clear we both welcomed the company. She lived in Vermont, worked as a ski patroller, and had already completed both the Appalachian Trail and Continental Divide Trail, with the Pacific Crest Trail planned to complete her Triple Crown. Hiking with her through the rest of the climb was encouraging; swapping stories lightened the effort.
</p>
<p>
At Pico, Anaya diverted, and I continued alone. The climb was tough, but the forested terrain was beautiful, and I reached Jungle Junction, where the trail levels out for a bit. This was also where I took one of my favorite photos of the trip: the spruce and fir forest lit by sunbeams breaking through the canopy, a quiet and striking moment in the middle of the climb. By that point, I had already passed the conservative option for the day, 19.5 miles to Churchill Scott Shelter, and was committed to pushing the final miles to Cooper Lodge, just below Killington’s summit.
</p>
<p>
Cooper Lodge turned out to be a decrepit but well-used shelter near the top of the mountain. I arrived around sunset, pitched my tent, stretched, and did some hip-strengthening work before settling in for the night. Other hikers, including a thru-hiker, were also camping there. For a while I considered continuing on to the summit itself, just a few hundred more feet of climbing, but I was exhausted and not sure I’d find a suitable campsite up there. Instead, I stopped at about 3,900 feet, roughly 300 feet below the top, and called it good.
</p>
<p>
By the end of the day, I had covered 23.8 miles with 6,808 feet of elevation gain. After two consecutive long days, 23.5 miles to The Lookout and 23.8 miles to Cooper Lodge, I was tired, my feet were sore, but my Achilles and the other areas I’d been worried about were holding up well. Overall, I was feeling good and ready to keep pressing forward.

<p>
The next day, I woke up at Cooper Lodge knowing that, because I was at the top of a mountain, the morning would begin with a big descent. The morning atmosphere was foggy and gray, twilight-like, with the shelter area cloaked in mist. Going up to the summit of Killington Peak wasn’t worth it since there would be no views, so I just got moving down the trail. It was cold up there, probably down into the mid-30s overnight. The day began with that long descent. The surroundings were beautiful, high, forested ridges, rolling clouds, and all the picturesque scenery you think of when imagining Vermont, but there weren’t many notable landmarks. Some spots were supposed to have views, but the fog blocked them, and though I was enjoying the forest, I found myself wishing for more expansive landscapes. Killington is one of the bigger mountains in the range, and once you leave the top near the ski area, the trail runs through one of the more remote sections in terms of road access, which gave it a wilder feeling.
</p>
<p>
Eventually, I reached the bottom of the descent and took a bathroom break. Not much happened until around mile 11.5, when I arrived at Clarendon Gorge. This spot was stunning, with a rocky opening, a massive river running below, and a suspension bridge crossing it. I refilled water, took a break, and tried to cool off since the day had warmed up quite a bit. In fact, it was hot enough that I ditched my pants and hiked in just my underwear for the rest of the day. The timing was unmatched as immediately when I ditched the pants, I passed a group of about twelve older women on a guided backpacking trip. From there, I faced a climb out of the gorge that was bigger than I had expected, about 1,200 feet total. It was a nice stretch, though marred by the sight of human development in the distance, and I found myself still hoping for more pristine views.
</p>
<p>
Because the day had started with such a big descent, I knew I could probably go farther than usual with less climbing ahead. I was busy thinking through water options, food plans, and mileage goals for the day when I ran into a Trail Magic set-up by a man from Albany, NY. Now, this wasn’t any run-of-the-mill Trail Magic set-up, instead it was fully kitted out with fresh food, fruit, charging stations, trash, and anything a hiker could want. Immediately, I plopped into the chair and started guzzling down hot dogs, Gatorades, Oreos, cookies, and whatever else I could shove down the gullet. I stayed for nearly 45 minutes and swapped stories with the generous man before continuing down the trail. By mile 19, I reached a shelter option but chose to push on, thinking about food, resupplies, and the broader goals of my trip. I made my way toward White Rocks Junction and the Rock Garden, but things turned frustrating. On a rocky ridgeline stretch, I realized all the white blazes had been scratched out. Looking at the map, I confirmed I was still on the AT, but the vandalism left me second-guessing. Without clear landmarks, it felt like I could be making a six-mile mistake if the trail had been rerouted. I pressed on, annoyed and uncertain, until I finally reached a recognizable landmark that reassured me I was on the right path.
</p>
<p>
From there, I had just a mile left to reach Little Rock Pond Shelter. The walking into camp was easy, and I got in at 25.1 miles for the day, though it took longer than expected. I filled up on water, started soaking dinner, and considered pushing another 3.5 miles to Big Branch Shelter. The climb would only have been 600 to 800 feet, not much, but I found myself looking around and second-guessing the thought to push on. 1.) It was still early on the trip; 2.) the beauty of Little Rock Pond was staggering; and 3.) there were plenty of other hikers. I asked myself why I’d tack on more miles when I could just enjoy the spot I was already in. For the only time on this trip, I set two goals for the day and chose the shorter one, staying at Little Rock Pond.
</p>
<p>
I slept in the shelter, where I met a guy named Pedestrian Crossing. He was finishing the Long Trail for the seventh time, worked as a psychotherapist, and did expert testimony against pharmaceutical companies. He gave me some advice, some of it useful, some not, but one thing he said really stuck: you don’t need to fight the trail, you have to let the trail come to you. It was exactly what I needed to hear, since I had just spent miles stewing over the vandalized blazes. 
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, sleeping in the same shelter as him was a mistake. He snored and got up to pee eight times during the night, turning on his headlamp each time and shining it my way. By morning, I was frustrated and tired, especially since I had been hoping for a solid night’s sleep before an early start. Still, the day had been a good one overall: 25.1 miles with 4,715 feet of ascent, from Cooper Lodge to Little Rock Pond. It was a beautiful area, one I’d love to revisit, though next time I’d avoid sharing a shelter with someone so inconsiderate.
</p>
<p>
I woke up early the next morning to start day five in the dark, knowing it would be an important one since I needed to get to Manchester Center for a resupply at the post office. Before the trip began, I had organized all my food, half to carry at the start and half to pick up in Manchester Center to cover the remainder of the hike. With that in mind, I hit the trail around 5am, doing a fair bit of night hiking through the boggy terrain around Little Rock Pond. By mile two, I was fortunate to come across a pit toilet with toilet paper, which was a surprisingly big morale boost and helped with water management. From there, I passed Big Branch Shelter, then Lost Pond Shelter, and soon had a climb up to Baker Peak. At only 2,700 or 2,800 feet, Baker Peak wasn’t tall, but sitting in the Big Branch Wilderness, it offered one of the first big views of the surrounding mountains. The summit was rocky and scarred from glaciation, and while the views were striking, they were also dotted with signs of human development, roads and quarries in the distance, which tempered the wilderness feeling.
</p>
<p>
Descending from Baker Peak, I reached Griffith Lake, a popular camping spot for northbound Long Trail hikers, and passed quite a few people there. The social interactions continued when I stopped at Peru Peak Shelter to rest, elevate my feet, and fill water before the climb to Styles Peak. There I met a hiker named Extra, a disabled Army veteran and former West Point grad, and we connected quickly over shared ties to the Hudson Valley, especially the Cold Spring and West Point area. Hiking together up Peru Peak and then Styles Peak, he shared stories from the military, the corporate world, and his time on trail. At the summit, we ran into two of his companions, Flip and Flop, an older couple from North Carolina. I enjoyed their company but had to part ways since I needed to keep moving to reach my resupply. Staying in town hadn’t been something I was planning on, but it tugged at me as an option. I wanted to stay out on trail as much as possible, but I also knew town could offer recovery, calories, and camaraderie. With that debate in the back of my mind, I descended to Mad Tom Notch Road and climbed Bromley Mountain, another ski area near Manchester. The summit was open, with views from the top of the ski lift, a warming hut, and a tower for even broader panoramas. It felt great to be there, and descending a ski slope was a unique change from the green tunnel.
</p>
<p>
By then I had 17 miles behind me and, after Bromley Shelter and Bromley Brook, I reached the road at mile 19.8. While descending Bromley, I had met an older couple day-hiking who ended up offering me a ride into Manchester Center after a bit of conversation. They dropped me at the post office, where I picked up my box, charged my phone and electronics, and called a few people to let them know I was safe. As I sat there, admittedly looking fairly homeless, I felt the weight of the challenge ahead: at around mile 97 or 98, I still had over 125 miles to cover in five days. It was daunting, and I found myself hedging, thinking about alternative exit points like Pittsfield or Dalton if I couldn’t make the full distance. By 2:30pm, I had already done 20 miles and then spent two hours at the post office organizing food and charging gear.
</p>
<p>
From there I walked half a mile into the heart of the town. In hindsight, I should have stopped for a meal, but instead I looked for a ride back to the trail. The one I got was memorable: a woman in a crop top driving a convertible sports car who made an illegal U-turn to pick me up. She was recently divorced, asked if I had anyone waiting at home, and gave me a pear as we talked, definitely a “cougar on the prowl” moment. She dropped me back at the trailhead, and I hiked the last 2.5 miles to Spruce Peak Shelter. Supposedly this spot had the best water on the trail, according to Pedestrian Crossing, but all I found was a shallow puddle. I had banked on a better source and hadn’t carried enough water to last for the night, so I ended up scooping water with a Ziploc bag just to get by. My plans for laundry and chores evaporated, but at least the shelter itself was fantastic, with a sliding door and no other occupants. I stayed alone, wrapping up a 22.5 mile day with 4,495 feet of climbing. Despite Peru Peak, Stiles Peak, and Bromley, the day wasn’t too intense.
</p>
<p>
I started the next morning at Spruce Peak Shelter with very little water, not reaching the next source until three miles in. Thirsty, I pressed on to Prospect Rock at mile 2.2, a beautiful vista where I met some Long Trail hikers who reassured me that water was just ahead. At 3.1 miles, crossing into the Lye Brook Wilderness, I found plenty of it and refilled. The Wilderness Area surprised me, not with big views but with its serene, condensed forest walking, which made for a peaceful morning. By mile 7.6, I exited the Wilderness Area, and at mile 8.0 reached Stratton Pond. It was a cold morning where you could see your breath, and I had been hiking in my fleece hoodie. Feeling grimy, I stripped down and swam in the pond, washing myself and some clothes. The water was frigid, and I came out shivering, but the solitude was unforgettable. I was completely alone, hearing only the flap of birds’ wings across the water, soaking in the stillness of the Vermont wilderness. It struck me as a rare, special moment, an iconic pond in the Green Mountains, often crowded in summer, all to myself.
</p>
<p>
The jackhammering shiver spell gave way after a mile or so and from there I began climbing up Stratton Mountain. For a 4,000-footer in New England, I expected a brutal ascent, but it was surprisingly easy. At the top, the fire tower offered views of Somerset Reservoir, Glastenbury Mountain, and the ranges stretching off in the distance. Looking toward Glastenbury, I weighed my options: Kid Gore Shelter at mile 23 or Goddard Shelter at 27.3. I decided to shoot for Kid Gore, grab water, and then reassess. Feeling good when I arrived to Kid Gore, I pushed on to Goddard. The timing was perfect: I reached the summit as the sun was setting and had hoped to watch it from the fire tower. Unfortunately, the ladder was pulled up and the tower was closed, so I missed out. Still, I descended to Goddard Shelter and, around the corner, ran into Happy, a hiker Extra had mentioned.
</p>
<p>
Happy was a 23-year-old from Dartmouth doing the Long Trail southbound, and we hit it off quickly. We joked about the imbalance of northbound versus southbound hikers, shared stories, and laughed about my encounters with older women on trail, she suggested my trail name should be Cougar Cub, which might stick. It felt great to connect with someone my age after days of mostly older company. As night fell, I pitched my tent, filled up on the excellent water nearby, and spent time stretching and massaging sore muscles while watching the stars appear. The sky grew darker as the waning gibbous moon rose late, and between 9:30 and 10pm. I had incredible views of the stars. I even managed some astrophotography, capturing the brilliance of the night sky from Glastenbury. It was a magical way to end the day before settling into my tent for a deep, much-needed sleep.
</p>
<p>
All told, it was 27.3 miles with 5,705 feet of gain, from Spruce Peak Shelter to Goddard Shelter, a long, rewarding day capped by solitude, connection, and starlight.
</p>
<p>
The next morning, I got up with the intention of an early start, but chores and conversation with Happy slowed me down. I finally left camp around 7am, beginning with the descent from Glastenbury. The upper slopes were beautiful, with spruce, fir, and birch forest, but otherwise the early miles passed without much incident. Around mile 10.1, the trail crossed a road into Bennington, followed by a very steep climb, about 2,000 feet straight up to Harmon Hill. A quarter of the way into the climb I met a hiker named Shakedown, around my age, who shared an intense backstory of addiction, heavy partying, and a corporate career he walked away from before starting a southbound thru-hike of the Appalachian Trail. He mentioned that he’d definitely see me down the trail, but I’m not sure he knew the intensity of the pace that I needed to keep to finish the trip. We never crossed paths again.
</p>
<p>
At the top of Harmon Hill, I was surprised by how beautiful it was. The views were sweeping, and I stopped to sign the logbook with my trail name, Cougar Cub. On the descent I ran into a woman with the trail name Legend, who was on the verge of becoming the oldest female thru-hiker in Appalachian Trail history. She was just ten miles from finishing, and although there was a technicality, hikers were allowed to carry 2024 mileage into 2025 due to a policy change caused by Hurricane Helene, her accomplishment was still impressive. Meeting her at that moment, with her joy and energy so close to the end, felt special.
</p>
<p>
From there, the trail meandered past beaver ponds and shelters as I worked toward the Vermont–Massachusetts border at mile 24.4. Reaching it by 5pm was my goal, since that would mean I had completed the 152 miles of Vermont in less than five days and twenty hours, which felt like a satisfying milestone. I snapped a photo at the border, proud to have crossed the state at a solid clip. With daylight left, I pressed on past my initial target of 26.7 miles and eventually reached North Adams at mile 28.5. Unsure about staying in town or beginning the Greylock climb so late, I chose to stealth camp just outside of North Adams, pitching my tent right off the trail. By the end of the day, I had logged 29.6 miles with 5,102 feet of climbing and a punishing 7,631 feet of descent. My feet were sore, not from injury but from the dull, numbing fatigue of long miles, and I knew the next day would test me even harder.
</p>
<p>
Determined to cover ground, I started before dawn with a night hike, facing the steep climb up Mount Williams and then Mount Greylock. Having skipped pushing to a shelter the night before, I had that climb waiting first thing. It was a tough effort, taking nearly two and a half hours to cover 5.2 miles with a heavy pack, but the rewards were worth it. Along the way, a clearing near Mount Prospect Ledge offered a cloud inversion spilling over the valleys, one of the most memorable views of the trip. From there I topped out on Williams, entered the cooler spruce-fir forest, and eventually pushed up to Greylock’s summit.
</p>
<p>
At the top, Bascom Lodge provided water and bathrooms, giving me a chance to clean my cold-soak jar, refill bottles, and regroup. Few people were around, and the quiet made the stop memorable. Not long after I set out again, I encountered a porcupine on the trail. For nearly five minutes it ran twenty feet ahead, stopping to glance back at me before continuing, forcing me to hit rocks with my trekking poles to coax it forward. Eventually the trail turned and the porcupine went straight, leaving me with my first and only porcupine sighting of the trip, a funny, unexpected bit of wilderness interaction.
</p>
<p>
By then I was low on water, and the map showed few sources, so I aimed for the road crossing at mile 12.9 where a gas station and Dunkin’ Donuts lay just off-trail. There, I launched into what became an eating performance for the ages: two sausage, egg, and cheese croissants, two donuts, five Clif Bars, and two fig bars to carry out. Refilled and energized, I pushed on through Cheshire, climbing to the Cobbles and Crystal Mountain, before making it into Dalton, nine miles later. The long road walk into town felt tedious, but Dalton offered a welcome break. I ducked into a coffee shop for a muffin and banana, then stepped next door to a sub shop for a massive 12-inch chicken parm sandwich, two full cutlets smothered in sauce and mozzarella. After inhaling it all, I told myself to grind out the last ten miles of the day.
</p>
<p>
The minutes felt like hours at the end of the day as I dragged up climbs and managed my aching feet. I passed Kay Wood Shelter at mile 25.2 and kept pressing, eventually reaching a road crossing at mile 31.8. Just beyond was Blueberry Hill Farm, home to the famed “Cookie Lady,” who lets hikers camp on her lawn. It turned out to be one of the best surprises of the trip: fresh cookies, endless water, charging outlets, and even a porta potty. I camped there on the grass, grateful for the hospitality, and slept deeply. The day closed at 31.8 miles with 7,090 feet of gain, a long but deeply rewarding push that capped off another milestone in the hike.
</p>
<p>
I knew after the long day, with the pounding my feet had taken and the pain I was in by the end of the day, that the next day was going to be hard. Still, I also knew that getting through the day would set me up to finish the trail the following morning, which was motivating. I left the Cookie Lady’s place and soon reached October Mountain Shelter, just 2.2 miles in. From there, I passed some ponds and climbed a small mountain. The only real landmark was a road that led into Lee, Massachusetts, which I bypassed. Soon after, I had to cross the Massachusetts Turnpike, a weird moment in contrast to the otherwise quiet trail. Before that crossing, I dealt with a lot of condensation from sleeping on a grassy lawn the night before, so I had to dry my tent and sleeping bag around mile 9.5. Afterward, I hit a beautiful stretch through the Upper Goose Pond area, which was flat and peaceful. My goal for the day was to reach some pastures about seven miles ahead and then decide what to do from there.
</p>
<p>
When I got to the pastures, I knew there was a climb up the Tyringham Cobble. I expected to see some day hikers there, which I did, and the climb wasn’t bad. The bigger challenge was that this was another dry stretch of trail, with very few people around. I spent much of the day in my own head, dealing with sore feet and fatigue. After coming off such a hard day before, I had a mental target: the Shaker Campsite at mile 21.1. It wasn’t supposed to be anything special, just a place to camp and call it a night, saving the harder climbs for the final day. But when I got there, I wasn’t impressed, it wasn’t pretty, and I was still feeling decent, so I decided to keep going. I aimed for North Mount Wilcox Shelter at mile 25.2, which required climbing back up around 2,000 feet. On the way, I passed a nice campsite at a junction where I could have stopped, but I still had daylight left and enough energy, so I pushed farther. I ended up making it to South Mount Wilcox Shelter at 26.9 miles for the day. I’d heard about a father-daughter duo staying there, and that gave me a sense of safety. It turned out to be a smart push, because it set me up for a very manageable final day. The day’s climbing totaled 4,741 feet, not terrible given the mileage, and I went to sleep knowing I was within striking distance of the finish.
</p>
<p>
South Wilcox Shelter had two buildings, and I stayed in a bunk in the newer, lower one. I got a great night’s sleep and woke up early, hitting the trail at 5:56 a.m. I only had 10.5 miles to go before meeting my fiancée at the road leading into Great Barrington, MA. Early in the day I passed some ledges around mile one and a beautiful pond at mile one and a half. Around mile five, I went by Ice Gulch and then a shelter at 5.4. The highlight of the morning was a jagged ridge section between miles 7.5 and 8.5, where I got incredible views: a perfectly sunny, bluebird sky above me, and below, a valley filled with clouds covering Great Barrington. It was a surreal moment, like standing between two worlds.
</p>
<p>
From there it was a long descent to the road, where I finished around 10:00am on September 14. That wrapped up 227 miles of the Appalachian Trail through Vermont and Massachusetts in under eight and a half days. It was an amazing experience. I had about fifteen minutes to myself on the roadside before Olivia arrived, which gave me space to sit and take it all in. The mileage for that final day was 10.5, with 1,717 feet of climbing, nothing too crazy, mostly descending. I even saw a bear that morning about two hours before I got picked up, a fitting surprise near the end.
</p>
<p>
Finishing the trip reminded me that while the physical side of these hikes is demanding, the real weight lies in the mental and emotional takeaways. The trail always gives me more than just miles and fitness, it leaves me with perspective and profound reflections that linger long after I’m back home.
</p>
<p>
There were a few things that stuck out in particular from this trip, the first being the importance of real experience in life. That lesson hit me hard in North Adams. I was walking down the sidewalk at sunset, with Greylock and Williams rising in the distance, hanging above the town. The sky was lit with this beautiful glow, and I was moving through a neighborhood, glancing into people’s windows as I passed. House after house, what I saw was Netflix, screens flickering as people stayed inside, watching movies instead of stepping outside to witness the sunset unfolding right behind them. The contrast struck me: people choosing the easy thing over the beautiful thing. Meanwhile, I had been out there for days, finishing off a 30-mile day, exhausted but surrounded by an experience so breathtaking it filled me up. It hit me like a truck how easy it is, in today’s world, to hand ourselves over to screens and technology, saving real experiences for a vacation or two each year. I don’t want that. I try to live intentionally, tapping into the natural world, into culture, into conversations with strangers, trying to live a real human life instead of separating myself behind technology and a screen.
</p>
<p>
That ties directly to my second takeaway: technology is a tool. Just like a hammer, it’s useful for certain jobs, but completely out of place in others. My phone was an incredible tool for recording my thoughts, serving as a guidebook and GPS, letting me call family to check in, and capturing the practical side of the journey. But the moment you drift into using it for YouTube, Reddit, Instagram, or whatever else, it stops being a tool and becomes a distraction. It pulls you out of your real life and into a fake one. After these trips, I have to remind myself constantly not to slip back into that trap. It’s easy when I’m fresh off trail, but months later, when I haven’t been out in a while, the temptation creeps in—“What does society think about this? What do strangers online think about that?” And I have to remind myself: it doesn’t matter. What matters is living my life. Even if that means “living under a rock,” it’s better than losing touch with real experiences.
</p>
<p>
Another huge takeaway was the power of human connection. On these trips, I make it a point to talk to strangers as much as I can. There’s no transactional value, no expectation, I know I’ll never see them again, but the flicker of recognition, the perspective shift that happens in those moments, is powerful. With strangers, I’ve had conversations about things it’s taken me years to open up about with my closest friends. There’s something freeing in the openness. And it shows me how little difference there really is between us as human beings, no matter what the news or society says. We’re all inhabiting this same moment in time on this planet, and though our experiences vary, the essence of being human ties us together. It’s a shame to let preconceived notions, fear, or indifference get in the way of that. Connection, empathy, openness, those are the things that make life real.
</p>
<p>
And here’s the thing: I’m not some endlessly vibrant person with boundless energy to give. A lot of the people I meet are quirky, quiet, or wildly different from me. Sometimes it’s just about sharing a moment in time with someone else, and that’s enough. It’s funny, when I’m in street clothes, no one looks twice. But if I’m in town with a backpack, sweaty and smelly, people stop to talk. It shouldn’t take obvious markers like that to spark human interest, but that’s often the case. And I’ve realized I need to be more intentional about creating those connections back home too, not just when I’m out hiking. At the end of the day, we’re all just trying to get through life the best we can. Our beliefs and values may differ, shaped by our experiences, but it’s worth meeting people where they are, having conversations, and seeing what you can learn from them. That’s real living.
</p>
<p>
The last big lesson was about emotions. Out on the trail, I tap into emotions so deeply that they overwhelm me at times, clarity, empathy, pain, joy, sorrow, gratitude. For a long time, I thought I had lost that. I thought I was moving through the world numb, a lost cause. But through bike touring, backpacking, and trail running, I’ve rediscovered the depth of human feeling. I’ve learned to see the good in people, the grit and perseverance in myself, and the immense amount of gratitude I have for this life. Feeling those emotions fully, without tamping them down, is what makes life vivid. The moment you stop feeling is the moment life becomes dull. I’m grateful these experiences have brought me back to a place where I can feel deeply and clearly. Even though my feet hurt and my body aches, I don’t want to lose the intensity of this moment, this crown jewel of raw emotion. I feel light, not because I lost weight, but because life feels like it’s flowing into me rather than me forcing it into shape. Coming out of this trip, I hope I can hold onto these insights and let them radiate into my life for days, weeks, months, and years to come.
</p>
<p>
For now, it’s time to keep living, to stay open to new experiences, new people, new emotions. I’ve just finished 227 miles through Vermont and Massachusetts, connecting a continuous footpath from the high point of New Jersey to Dartmouth College. I don’t know how much more of the AT I’ll end up doing, to be honest, but this section is done. And I can’t wait to see what the next trip brings.
