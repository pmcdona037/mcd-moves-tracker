<p>
I think this is one of those trips I’ll remember for the rest of my life. I’ve been telling people it’s the coolest experience I’ve ever had, and I truly believe that. Not only was it naturally beautiful and physically demanding, but it also challenged me mentally and emotionally in ways I didn’t expect. So, as I go through this recap, my goal is to not only cover the day-to-day logistics but also share the thoughts that were bouncing around in my head, my emotional state, and how everything came together.
</p>
<p>
To start, let’s rewind to the week leading up to the hike. The Wednesday before, I packed everything. I wasn’t planning to hit the trail until Saturday, but I wanted to get ahead of it. That week, I found myself constantly adding items to my luggage as the weather looked like it was turning for the worst. A storm was predicted to hit the high country over the weekend and I found myself grabbing neoprene booties, microspikes, and more substantial cold-weather gear. By the time I was ready to head out of Cold Spring, I had nearly my entire gear closet with me. On Thursday, I had dinner in the City with friends, which also happened to be my last training day before the trail. After dinner, I stayed the night in Brooklyn Heights with my partner at her older brother's apartment. I remember it being one of those moments where the trip felt so close yet still so far away. As I lied awake in bed, the gnawing anticipation made the hands of time shift into a slow-motion march around the circumference of the clock. Mercifully, the morning came and I found myself alone in a Brooklyn apartment and felt the anticipation build to a boiling point. My thoughts kept spinning: Is the weather going to hold? Will I need to flip directions? Am I even ready for this? There was a mix of excitement and doubt swirling in my head. Eventually, I left for LaGuardia, which, let me tell you, is quite a journey from Brooklyn Heights. The flight was uneventful, and I landed late Friday night. My friend picked me up, and I spent the night clogging up the National Weather Service’s servers as I maniacally checked the weather, trying to decide whether I’d take a bus to the trail in the morning or hang back.
</p>
<p>
After being assured by my friend that early-season snowstorms in late September were few and far between, the snow gods decided that Saturday, September 21st would be a great day to dump half a foot of snow above 10,000 feet. My original plan to start near Leadville or Twin Lakes didn’t seem too smart with a fresh coat of wet snow, so I pivoted and spent Saturday with my buddy catching up on life, playing pickleball with some of his friends, and working out the new logistics for the trail with the starting point in Denver. As the countdown to the start came closer, I found myself less stressed and anxious than I expected. I felt at ease with what was to come and I was ready to get going. As I noodled on how I wanted day one to go, it became clear that an early morning was in the cards as I wanted to give myself as much daylight as possible to see how far I could get. My buddy and I went to bed with the gameplan of getting out around sunrise, so, bright and early on Sunday morning, we drove about 15 minutes to Waterton Canyon, the northern terminus of the Colorado Trail. There was a small hiccup right at the start: I realized I’d left my hiking poles in the back of my friend’s truck. He’d already driven off, so I had to call him to turn around and bring them back. Once I had the poles, I finally set out. It was 45 degrees and raining.
</p>
<p>
The first part of the trail runs through Waterton Canyon, which is essentially a wide gravel road. There’s a river flowing alongside you, with mountains rising up on either side, but the experience felt more suburban than any of the trails I frequent in New York. I had on my stupid-looking poncho and was passed by nearly every trail runner in Colorado before reaching the transition point where the trail diverged from the road and found its more natural form as a footpath. That’s when things got quiet for the first time, the swarms of runners subsided and the rumbling trucks were now out of sight and out of mind. It was the first moment where it really hit me: the hike was no longer a plan or something in the distance, it was right now. From that point forward, it was just me and 175 miles of trail winding through the Rocky Mountains.
</p>
<p>
The initial climb out of Waterton Canyon takes you into the forest, and as I ascended in the forest I was struck by how the morning had this elegantly cloaked beauty that appeared and disappeared in a flash. The mountains peaked out from behind the grey sheets of fog that floated gently in the open space between the forested mountaintops and all sound was sucked away by the faint whistle of the wind. The lack of rocks underfoot allowed for me to look around and enjoy the scenery of the waking world in the morning, and before I knew it I arrived at the first water source, Bear Creek, which is about 8.6 miles in. By this time of year, it was just a tiny trickle. I refilled there, knowing I had about eight miles to the next water source at the South Platte River. While hiking this stretch, I came across the only southbound multi-day hiker I’d see on the entire trip. He had a big backpack, a speaker, and hiking boots—definitely someone moving at a slower pace. He mentioned he was hiking from Denver to Breckenridge. It was cool to see someone else out there, but after that, I didn’t see anyone else going my direction for the rest of the trail. When I reached the top of the ridge, the view was breathtaking. The clouds were still hanging low, and off in the distance, I could see the South Platte River cutting through the landscape. The area to the west looked drier, with some burn scars from past wildfires. I knew from studying maps that’s where I was headed next. After getting to the top of the ridge, I started feeling an all-too-familiar ache in my legs. It hit me hard: Is this how it’s going to be the entire trip? Am I only going to be able to manage 15 miles a day? Is this whole thing going to fall apart because my body can’t handle it? Are the long-term complications from COVID going to mess up this trip too? I even started worrying about needing to resupply earlier than planned at mile 70 in Jefferson. It was a lot to process. But within 5 minutes, everything changed. My body loosened up, my mind cleared, and I suddenly felt like a well-oiled machine. I cruised down the descent to the South Platte River. When I got there, I briefly got turned around trying to find the trail on the other side of the river. It only took a couple of minutes to figure it out, and soon, after refilling my bottles, I was climbing again.
</p>
<p>
This climb felt hotter and the clouds burning off above did no favors on this front. The landscape changed drastically. I was out of the forest and into a desert-like environment with wide-open views in every direction. It was sandy, dusty, and dry, a stark contrast to the damp, cool, shaded forest I’d just left behind. That environment stayed consistent until I hit mile 26, where I reached a volunteer fire station. Due to a lack of naturally occurring water in the area, the fire station has a spigot on the back of the building where hikers can fill up on water. After filling up, I traced alongside a road for about a mile until I arrived at the Little Scraggy Trailhead. This marked the end of Segment 2 of the Colorado Trail. It was a godsend—a chance to use the bathroom and take a quick break before continuing. From there, the trail remained relatively easy, giving me a bit of a reprieve as I moved unnatural. After a few hours, I arrived at the single-track that climbed up into the Front Range. The trail quickly pushed deeper into the Front Range. The trail bounced from heavily forested terrain to arid, open land, and eventually returned to the forest where it ran through an area popular with the local mountain bikers. Once I hit 33 miles on the day, I started looking at my map, trying to figure out the best place to camp. There were plenty of flat spots in the forest, but I wondered if I could find something better. I decided to push on and eventually made it to mile 35.5, where I stumbled upon a campground. The campground was a bit off the trail, maybe 0.1 or 0.2 miles, and required a left turn if you were heading southbound. It opened up into a massive meadow beneath a towering mountain I’d been eyeing from a distance all day. The campground itself was well-equipped, with picnic tables, designated camping spots, and pit toilets. It felt like a great place to set up for the night. After setting up camp, I used the bathroom and started to unwind. But then, out of nowhere, I heard two gunshots. My mind immediately flashed back to a similar experience I’d had in Georgia. Thankfully, there was nothing more after that, so I crawled into my sleeping bag and tried to sleep.
</p>
<p>
Recapping that first day, I hiked 35.5 miles. My moving time was 10 hours, 15 minutes, and 22 seconds, giving me an average pace of 3.46 miles per hour. I climbed a total of 6,170 feet. This was my biggest hiking day ever, surpassing my previous record of 30 miles in Harriman State Park. What really stood out to me, though, was how good I felt, mentally and physically. The miles came easier than I’d expected, thanks in part to the beautifully maintained trail.
</p>
<p>
That said, the end of the day brought the usual anxiety I feel on the first night of a trip. Being alone in the Rockies, I couldn’t help but question if this was the right decision. But I reminded myself of the huge day I’d just had and the strength I felt throughout. Eventually, I shook off the nerves and settled into sleep. When I woke up the next morning, I found that condensation had collected on my tent. I wiped it down with my towel, shook it out, and got ready for the day. Luckily, the pit toilet didn't run away overnight, so I made good use of it before heading back to the trail.
</p>
<p>
The next morning, I began the day by walking through the same forest where I’d camped. It wasn’t long before I hit a significant climb, one that gradually took me up to the 10,000-foot mark. The climb stretched over about five miles, eventually leading to Long Gulch. Long Gulch was a standout section for me. It marked the first time I hit 10,000 feet and introduced me to the high, open landscapes I’d been anticipating when planning the trip. The trail wove through a mix of meadow-like areas tracing the forest’s edge, with towering mountains rising around me. It felt like a transition point, with the scenery becoming more dramatic and expansive. This section also was my first introduction to the golden aspens blanketing the mountainsides with their soft translucent leaves fluttering in the wind. I couldn’t help but gawk at the beauty that surrounded me as I had never seen a changing aspen in my life prior to my walk through Long Gulch. Although it didn’t feel like I was climbing, I was eventually brought to the top of a saddle at nearly 11,000 feet. From there, I started the descent, and one of the first sights on the other side of the saddle was massive, snow-covered peaks far out in the distance. These were the high mountains I knew I’d be walking into soon, but seeing them covered in snow gave me pause. I remembered debating whether to pack my microspikes before the trip. Ultimately, I decided to leave them, but now I was second-guessing that choice. Looking at those peaks, I couldn’t help but wonder if the snow would melt out by the time I reached them, or if I’d need to pick up a pair of spikes in Breckenridge. It wasn’t a full-blown anxiety spiral, but the thought of trudging through snow without proper traction stuck in my head as I continued on.

<p>
As I descended off the saddle after Long Gulch, the trail wove through the forest before opening up to a tall grassy area surrounded by aspens. To your left, if you’re heading southbound, a massive mountain with a dramatic ridgeline dominates the view. The ever-changing perspective of the mountain gave a more palpable sense of being part of something beautiful, instead of just seeing something beautiful. It wasn’t necessarily the view that filled my heart and soul, it was the feeling that I had when walking through this place. I felt small, I soaked in the light and wind, I experienced the weightlessness of awe and wonder. This theme of natural beauty becomes a hallmark of the trail: while photos capture its picturesque qualities, the real magic lies in walking it. You’re surrounded by expansive views, vibrant aspens, and sunlight playing across the landscape in a way no picture can fully replicate. The experience of being immersed in it all is vastly different from simply looking at photos. As the day progressed, the scenery only grew more beautiful. Late afternoon brought more grassy areas and aspen groves, illuminated by the lowering sun, which gave everything a warm glow. I had set a personal goal to hit 30 miles for the day and, based on my pace, felt confident I’d make it. With the lessons from the first night still fresh, I planned to set up camp earlier, aiming for a 6pm stop to give myself plenty of time to settle in.
</p>
<p>
At mile 66, I found the perfect campsite, an incredible spot on top of a hill, surrounded by trees for protection from the wind. The area was grassy, with sweeping views of distant peaks. It faced west, offering a front-row seat to a beautiful sunset. Below, a forest stretched out, dotted with aspens glowing in the golden light. It was an fantastic place to spend the night. Reaching the site marked a 30.5-mile day, completed in 9 hours, 7 minutes, and 22 seconds, with a 3.34 mph pace and an elevation gain of 5,803 feet. The miles had flown by, and I felt good physically and mentally.
</p>
<p>
At the start of the second day, I had awoke that morning still feeling some of the anxiety from the first night, but as the day unfolded, I felt myself settling into the rhythm of the trail. The Colorado Trail is home to a lot of wildlife, everything from bears and coyotes to wolves, elk, and moose. During mating season, animals like elk and moose are more aggressive and unpredictable, which added an extra layer of unease. However, as the day went on, I became more comfortable, my nervousness giving way to a sense of peace and focus. This mental shift gave me space to reflect deeply on my life. Thoughts of family, friends, my partner, and my own identity surfaced. I’d been intentional about staying off my phone, avoiding distractions like music or checking for service, which forced me to sit with my thoughts and let them evolve naturally. The solitude gave me time to think about my purpose and what I want from life, allowing me to connect with myself in a way that everyday life rarely permits. At the same time, the logistics of the hike occupied my mind. I was constantly doing math: calculating miles to the next water source, estimating arrival times, and planning when and where to eat or rehydrate food. Balancing these practicalities with deeper introspection made for a profoundly formative day.
</p>
<p>
As the sun dipped below the horizon, I settled into my tent, relishing the sense of accomplishment of hitting 66 miles in two days. Then, I heard an elk call. At first, it sounded distant, but over time, the calls grew closer. I assumed it was a moose at the time, only later realizing it was an elk after hearing similar calls while in Breckenridge. Regardless, it unnerved me. What do you even do if an elk or moose walks into your campsite? I know how to handle bears, but during mating season, larger animals like elk and moose can be unpredictable and aggressive. The constant calls created a game of cat and mouse. The elk would come closer, and I’d make noise to scare it off, but it would return after a while. Eventually, around 1:30 am, I decided to take action. I stepped out of my tent with a headlamp on and pepper spray in hand and scoped out the immediate area. I quickly realized that the animal was a bit further than my imagination was warning me of. I then created an armory of baseball-sized rocks to act as my quiver of weaponry and took a second to look up at the night sky. The stars dazzled above and I took a moment to appreciate its unique beauty in today’s modern world despite the situation. After calming myself, I returned to the tent, exhausted, and finally managed a few hours of restless sleep. In hindsight, I learned a valuable lesson: fear doesn’t help anyone if you let it consume you. Agency is essential, even if it’s something as simple as stepping outside and assessing the situation.
</p>
<p>
The next morning, I woke to an incredible sunrise, though the elk hadn’t left. I packed up quickly, eager to move on, knowing that the next section of the trail would bring a significant climb. The morning began with a beautiful stretch through Kenosha Pass, which was absolutely breathtaking. The aspens were at peak color, glowing in the sunrise, creating a palette of yellows, oranges, and reds. I felt fortunate to be there early, before the area got too crowded. There were plenty of day hikers, but the numbers were manageable, allowing me to take in the sweeping views. The trail opened up here, offering vast landscapes instead of the dense forests I’d been in. The first part of the day involved a descent into the valley, and I met a few northbound thru-hikers around my age, which was a great way to start the day. At Kenosha Pass, there was even a pit toilet, which I made use of. From there, around mile 75, the trail began a gradual climb. This section allowed mountain bikes, so the ascent was gentle but long, eventually leading to Georgia Pass. It was my first time hiking above the treeline, nearing 12,000 feet. This milestone brought a mix of excitement and anxiety. At 12,000 feet, you wonder how your body will respond, even if you’ve been close to 11,000 feet just a day before.
</p>
<p>
The climb to Georgia Pass was stunning. As I ascended, the trees thinned, revealing expansive views of rugged, rocky peaks. A towering mountain stood to the left of the trail (for southbound hikers), dominating the skyline. At the pass, I met a local mountain biker who frequently rides from Kenosha Pass to Georgia Pass. We chatted for a bit, and he kindly took my photo before I crossed the ridge. Crossing Georgia Pass also marked my first steps on the Continental Divide Trail (CDT), and it was then that I started to shift my focus to logistics. The mountain biker had asked about my plans for the rest of the day and if I was shooting for Breckenridge, but I initially dismissed it because it would have to be a 36 or 37 mile day. I had planned to camp around mile 96, about seven miles before town. However, as I descended through a dense forest, I began reevaluating. The descent felt wild and remote, and I hit a flow state where the miles seemed to fly by. My thoughts turned from introspection to calculations: Could I reach Breckenridge before nightfall? It would be tight, but I decided to go for it. Worst case, I’d camp and rest up. As I neared the campsite at mile 96, I found a beautiful spot with a bench and a flat area overlooking the valley leading to Breckenridge. It was my decision-point for the day. I had cell service and I called the Fireside Inn, a hostel in Breckenridge, and they had availability. After two restless nights, one with gunshots, the other with an elk keeping me up, I decided a night indoors would be a welcome reprieve. With that settled, I polished off a bag of peanut butter M&Ms for a quick energy boost and pushed on towards town. Three miles later, I rounded a corner and came face-to-face with a bull moose standing right on the trail. It was surreal. I skirted around it cautiously, snapping a few pictures before continuing. Despite the day’s momentum, the final stretch felt long. Fatigue set in, especially after tackling a steep climb with about 1,000 feet of elevation gain over two miles, comparable to Bull Hill, but at 10,000 feet. Finally, I reached the outskirts of Breckenridge, descending on a series of switchbacks that led to a highway crossing. From there, the trail passed through a small neighborhood before reaching a bus stop. I decided to hitchhike instead, and a kind German tourist picked me up, driving me the last 10 minutes to the hostel. During the ride, we swapped stories; he mentioned his concerns about bears in the U.S., which I found amusing after my own wildlife encounters.
</p>
<p>
As I stepped out of the car, I felt the sting of a huge blister on my left heel. It was my first major foot issue of the trip, and it hit hard. At the hostel, I stripped off my gear and managed to get my laundry done just before their cutoff time. Then, I grabbed dinner at Fatty’s Pizzeria. The food was nothing special, but it gave me time to plan the next leg of my hike. By the end of the day, I was flying high. Over three days, I’d covered 103 miles, including my longest single-day hike: 36.4 miles with 5,774 feet of elevation gain in just under 11 hours, maintaining a 3.35 mph pace. I texted friends, shared photos, and reveled in the accomplishment. Using rubbing alcohol and a safety pin, I popped and drained a blister, then taped it up, hoping it would heal overnight. As I lay in the hostel bunk alone, as no one else had checked in, I reflected on the solitude of the trail. While I appreciated the peacefulness, the loneliness felt sharper outside the typical thru-hiking season. The hostel’s quietness only amplified it. All things considered, it was an incredible stay at the hostel and I would highly recommend for anybody traveling through Breckenridge.
</p>
<p>
The next morning, I ate some leftover food, picked up my resupply box from the post office at 8:05 am, and caught the 8:15 am bus back to the trail. Sorting my food, I discarded unnecessary items, knowing I’d need only three days of food to reach mile 180. At the pace I was going, I felt confident in my plan. I started the trail at 8:30 am, earlier than I expected. Everything was ready, electronics charged, extra food packed, blisters taped, shower taken, fresh laundry done. I knew I was in for a tough day with a heavy pack weighed down with a fresh resupply, extra water for a climb, and an imposing ridge that I had to get up and over just outside of Breckenridge. That first climb was no joke. It took me to the highest point I’d traverse on the trail, crossing the ridge outside Breckenridge on the way to Copper Mountain.
</p>
<p>
The climb initially brought me through a lush forest, with streams flowing down the slopes and massive mountains looming above. Once I crossed the treeline at 11,700 feet, there was still another 300-foot push to reach the ridge. At the top, I was greeted by a spectacular ridge walk. Standing on this massive mountain, with Breckenridge visible far below, felt incredible. The ridge dropped off steeply, nothing to catch you for a thousand feet—but the views were breathtaking. Trail crews from the U.S. Forest Service and Rocky Mountain Youth Corps dotted the trail as they were making improvements now that the peak hiking season had passed. It was the first significant ridge walk of the trail, and the weather was perfect. There had been some anxiety about potential snow at this altitude, but the trail was clear. Toward the end of the ridge, there was a steeper climb, up to about 12,500 feet. It was the only time on the trail where I felt the altitude, my breathing was heavier, and my legs a little sluggish, but I powered through and felt great once I topped out. At the ridge's peak, I was rewarded with views of a massive snow-covered mountain ahead, its north-facing slope still white from the snow that fell a few days before. It was a surreal way to start the day, with about four and a half miles above the treeline, a solid hour and a half of walking through this extraordinary landscape. Everyone I passed seemed happy, the weather was ideal, and Copper Mountain came into view in the distance.

Descending to the Copper Mountain Ski Resort was relatively easy. A detour took me around some trail construction, but I lost the path briefly. Luckily, a guy driving a golf cart helped me out. He got me back on track, and within minutes, I stumbled upon a Starbucks. I treated myself to two Impossible breakfast sandwiches, and the barista, who had also hiked the Colorado Trail, told me the section that I was on was her favorite (Breckenridge to Kokomo Pass). We swapped stories, and I had a great time chatting with her before taking a much-needed bathroom break and charging my phone. Heading out of Copper, I saw five elk grazing on one of the ski slopes. The trail climbed back into the forest and eventually up to another section above the treeline. As I ascended toward Searle Pass, I passed Janet’s Cabin, nestled at the edge of the treeline. The area was stunning, with soft sunlight illuminating the grasses and flowers, their seeds floating like delicate bristles in the breeze. Shadows played on the high peaks, and the stunning view was only overshadowed by the blissful feeling that rushed over me.
</p>
<p>
Searle Pass, at 12,300 feet, offered 360-degree views of massive peaks and valleys in both directions. Marmots scurried around, seeming to cheer me on as I reached the top. The descent was more relaxed, a rolling, flat-ish path above the treeline with panoramic views. Off in the distance, I could see Mount Massive, Mount Elbert, and the Collegiate Peaks. I stopped to eat dinner near a crystal-clear mountain stream, grabbing water straight from the source. The day wasn’t over, though. I still had climbs up Elk Ridge and Kokomo Pass ahead, both over 12,000 feet. By the time I started descending for the day, I’d covered 27 miles. Exhaustion began to creep in as the sun set, and I searched for a good campsite. Turning a corner, I was hit with the most majestic views of the trip: a gradient of red, orange, yellow, and green aspens blanketing the mountainside, backlit by the golden sunset. The evergreens in the background and the illuminated peaks completed the scene. It was magical, a moment I’ll never forget. Just as I began to feel a deep peace, I experienced a sharp pain in my left foot, eerily similar to the peroneal tendonitis I’d dealt with in the past. I made a mental note to take it easy and found a campsite at mile 133, ending the day with 30.4 miles, 6,994 feet of climbing, and an average pace of 3.21 mph over 9 hours and 28 minutes of moving time.
</p>
<p>
Despite the challenges, foot pain, blisters, and even a chunk of my shoe’s outsole ripping off, I felt a deep sense of pride and connection to the past four days of moving through the mountains. Sitting outside my tent, stretching and soaking in the quiet forest, I realized how much I’d grown. That day’s hardships had melted away my fear and anxiety. I was 133 miles in, with just 47 to go. Going to bed, I felt strong, at peace, and incredibly grateful to be exactly where I was.
</p>
<p>
Thursday started with a frosty wake-up in the Camp Hale area. The ground was covered in a thin layer of frost, with the temperature hovering around 30°F. It was cold, crisp, and quiet, a stark contrast to the warmth of my sleeping bag. I avoided drinking the water in this area, partly due to warnings about asbestos and unexploded military ordnance scattered in the region. The first nine miles of the day were uneventful. The trail meandered through nondescript terrain, eventually crossing a highway leading to Leadville. The highlight of this stretch was reaching Tennessee Pass at mile nine, which had a pit toilet.
</p>
<p>
But Thursday wasn’t about ease; it was about digging deep. While Wednesday was a triumph of strength and flow, Thursday brought adversity. My left foot, which had been a nagging issue, started to hurt more, and the mental battle began. Crossing into the Holy Cross Wilderness marked the shift. Tennessee Pass is at mile 142, but the wilderness stretch from mile 150 to 155 was one of the most remote and challenging sections of this section. I knew if something went wrong here, like worsening foot pain, it would be incredibly difficult to get help. The terrain was steeper, rockier, and slower going. As I climbed above treeline, the foot pain intensified. It was a grind, both physically and mentally. I hadn’t been taking many breaks or eating enough, and the lack of fuel caught up with me. My pace slowed to a crawl, around two miles per hour, and for the first time on this trip, I felt truly vulnerable. I stopped, forced myself to eat and hydrate, and eventually found the strength to push through. The climb topped out, and descending offered some relief, though the pain lingered. By mile 161, I hit a small trail leading to Leadville, my mental safety net if things got bad. But I wasn’t stopping, I was determined to keep going. The day ended with one final climb after crossing the Leadville Fish Hatchery trails. At the top of my final climb, I found a flat campsite with an incredible view of Mount Massive and Mount Elbert. The sun was setting, painting the peaks in warm, golden light. I had service, too, so I checked in with loved ones, sharing the relief and joy of making it this far. It felt like the weight of the day, and the trail, melted away. That night, I camped at peace. No anxiety about wildlife or people, just a sense of accomplishment. I sat outside my tent, stretched, and took it all in. When I woke early the next morning, before my alarm, I opened the tarp to a sky filled with stars. It was soul-stirring moment.
</p>
<p>
By then, the realization had set in: I had hiked 165 miles, solo, through the Rockies. This wasn’t the Appalachian Trail in New York, this was more wild than anything I had previously experienced, and I was on the brink of finishing. All that remained were 15 final miles.

Friday morning started off easy, a couple of small climbs, cold air, and the towering presence of Mount Massive and Mount Elbert keeping me company. I made my way through groves of glowing yellow aspens, their leaves lit up by the morning sun. The trail eventually opened up, and I began seeing more hikers: people doing Twin Lakes day hikes or heading up Mount Massive and Mount Elbert. And then, I turned a corner and saw Twin Lakes spread out below me. I teared up on the spot. It was an overwhelming sense of accomplishment unlike anything I’d ever felt. The closest comparison might be reaching the Connecticut border on one of my earlier backpacking trips, but this was different. I had just walked here from Denver. Literally. Descending toward Twin Lakes was magical. The trail wound through massive aspen groves, their bright yellow leaves shimmering against the clear blue sky. I was so happy I even asked a few hikers to snap pictures of me. When I reached the bottom and crossed the highway at mile 175, it felt like I’d hit a milestone worth celebrating. But I wasn’t done yet, I had set out to hit mile 180, and that was still ahead of me. The final stretch started off with incredible scenery. Twin Lakes is, without exaggeration, one of the most beautiful places I’ve ever been. The vivid blue water, the golden aspens, the snow-dusted peaks in the distance, and the scattered clouds overhead all came together for an unforgettable scene. It was incredible, and I took some of my favorite photos of the entire trip there. But as I pushed past mile 175, the trail changed. The scenery gave way to dusty, desert-like terrain. My foot pain flared up, along with my blisters, and every step became a struggle. The temptation to stop was real, Twin Lakes was right there, and hitching a ride felt like an easy escape. But 180 miles was the goal, not 175. I reminded myself that quitting wasn’t an option. I slowed my pace to a crawl. My foot was in bad shape, and I worried about causing lasting damage if I pushed too hard. The funny thing is, I had this quirky goal of not shitting outside for the entire 180 miles. There was a pit toilet around mile 14 of the day, and I was determined to make it there for the perfect finish. But when I arrived, it was locked. Of course, it was locked! Foot throbbing, dust clinging to me, I trudged along the lake’s edge, mentally laughing at the absurdity of it all. Finally, I reached the end of the trail. There wasn’t any grand marker or celebratory finish line, just a random blaze on the trail near the highway. It was bittersweet. I turned around, took a picture of that last blaze, and stood there for a moment, letting it sink in. I had walked 180 miles, solo, through the Rocky Mountains. The accomplishment hit me hard, and I got emotional thinking about everything it took to get there.
</p>
<p>
The day's stats: 15.2 miles in 4 hours, 54 minutes, and 9 seconds. I averaged 3.1 miles per hour, climbing 1,312 feet of elevation. It was a relatively short day compared to others, but my foot pain made every mile feel twice as long.
</p>
<p>
Even though the trail was behind me, the adventure wasn’t over. I walked to the highway and stuck out my thumb, hoping for a ride. Rejection after rejection came as car after car passed by. Finally, after about 20 minutes, a woman in her early 30s turned around to pick me up. She was a tequila sales rep from Aspen heading to Buena Vista. She wasn’t even going my way but dropped me off at an intersection, where I waited another 25 minutes for a second ride. Eventually, two electricians from Leadville gave me a lift, dropping me at the bus station. From there, I took the free bus to Frisco, where my friend picked me up. That was it. I was done. That afternoon, we hit Whole Foods, and I went wild at the hot bar, dropping $35 on food and devouring every bite. Later, my buddy's family treated me to a big Italian dinner, and we finished the night at Andy’s for frozen custard. It was the perfect end to the adventure.
</p>
<p>
Completing 180 miles on the Colorado Trail, solo, over five and a half days, was a monumental accomplishment and one I’ll carry with me for a long time. As I reflect on the experience, I want to share the major themes and insights that surfaced during my time on the trail.
</p>
<p>
One of the biggest themes was exploring the relationship between solitude and loneliness. Spending time alone in the wilderness gave me the chance to reflect deeply, and I realized that while solo journeys are valuable for self-discovery, I truly value connection. Sharing successes, struggles, and experiences with others brings a deeper sense of fulfillment to me. This realization is one of the takeaways I’ll hold onto for future adventures. Another major theme was the profound connection I felt with nature. The raw beauty of Colorado, from vast landscapes to the changing colors of the aspens, strengthened my bond with the natural world. Being out there reminded me how small yet interconnected we are to the earth. It also reaffirmed the importance of protecting these spaces.
</p>
<p>
The hike pushed my physical and mental limits in ways that were both challenging and rewarding. I had health concerns before the trip and wasn’t sure how my body would hold up under stress. On the first day, I set a modest goal of 15 miles, but I ended up covering 35.5 miles, and I didn’t drop below 30 miles a day for the rest of the trip. Physically, it was grueling, but the mental challenges were even greater. I’ve failed at trips before, like my bike ride from Canada to New York City or section hikes of the Appalachian Trail. This time, I faced countless opportunities to quit, from gunshots on the first night and elk calls outside my tent on the second, to foot pain, shoe problems, and the temptation to call it at Twin Lakes. But at every turn, I made the harder decision to keep going. Those choices made me feel stronger and more resilient and ultimately transformed me into someone more anti-fragile.
</p>
<p>
This journey also forced me to consider how I want to live my life. I wrestled with whether I want my life to revolve around solo adventures or if I’d rather include others in these experiences. Right now, it feels more meaningful to share these journeys than to build a life entirely around being solo. The trip also clarified some things about where I live. While I’ve been in Cold Spring, I don’t think it’s the best fit for me anymore. I need a place with more social opportunities and like-minded people, Denver feels like a city I could truly call home. I also confronted some hard truths about myself, like my tendency toward selfishness. It’s been a protective mechanism that’s served me well in certain ways, but I know I need to acknowledge it, keep it in check, and lean on others to help me grow in this area.
</p>
<p>
One of the most valuable lessons was understanding the importance of choosing hard things. It’s so easy to coast through life, to fill your time with comfort and routine. But walking 180 miles through the Rockies at a quick pace, solo, pushed me to my limits and brought incredible growth. That sense of accomplishment, confidence, and self-reliance is something I’ll carry with me forever. Alongside this, the trip reaffirmed the importance of maintaining my health. It’s not just about living longer but about living fully, being able to hike, run, and enjoy the activities I love. This experience highlighted that health truly is wealth, and I’m committed to keeping myself in good physical and mental shape.
</p>
<p>
The trip also gave me a new appreciation for perspective and nuance. It’s easy to get stuck in your own thought bubbles, whether it’s about climate change, social issues, or personal beliefs. But everyone’s experiences shape their priorities, and I’ve realized the importance of understanding others’ views without imposing my own. Finally, the journey reminded me of the value of the people who truly care about you. Most people don’t give your accomplishments more than a passing thought, but the few who genuinely celebrate your successes are worth holding onto tightly.
</p>
<p>
This hike wasn’t just a physical challenge; it was a journey of self-discovery. It tested my body and mind and left me with a deep sense of fulfillment. The pain, like the ache in my foot, will fade, but the memories of seeing Twin Lakes from above, surrounded by golden aspens and snow-capped peaks, will stay with me forever. It’s not just the beauty of the trail but the growth I experienced along the way that makes it unforgettable.
</p>
<p>
To anyone reading this, I challenge you to do something hard, something you’re not sure you can accomplish. Push yourself to your limits, strip away distractions, and see what you’re capable of. The growth you’ll experience is unlike anything else. This was a defining moment in my life, and I’m so grateful to have had this opportunity. If you ever get the chance, go experience the Colorado Trail. Whether it’s Kenosha Pass, Twin Lakes, the stretch from Waterton to Twin Lakes, or the whole shebang, it’s worth it. This journey was truly the time of my life, and I’ll carry these lessons always.
